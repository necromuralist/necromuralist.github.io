There are various ways to edit tags with [[https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/][Beautiful Soup]], The [[https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#decompose][decompose]] method both removes the tag from the tree and destroys the object (along with all its descendants in the HTML tree). 

#+begin_src python
element = soup.find(id=tag_id)
element.decompose()
#+end_src

If you want to destroy tags around the one you found (along with the tag and its descendants in the tree) then call decompose on it's parent or parent's parent (and so on). Or figure out how to find its parent instead - whichever is easier.

#+begin_src python :results none
element.parent.parent.decompose()
#+end_src


After you edit the tree it might be a good idea to call [[https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#smooth][smooth]] to clean up a bit.

#+begin_src python :results none
soup.smooth()
#+end_src
