* Web Sockets

** Flask-SocketIO
   This combines flask with [[https://socket.io][socket.io]] (so there's an extra thing to learn, maybe). The author made a [[https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/easy-websockets-with-flask-and-gevent][blog post]] about it that gives a little more background around it and what advantages he thinks it has over flask-sockets. He also gave a talk at PyCon Ireland 2017 that is on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwux1TPZUwg&index=1&list=PLNeBS51Q0m98FAWRHwQLjV1vja2ZdWpCb][YouTube]].

SecDevOps. N. p., 2017. Web. 13 Feb. 2018.]] This is a two-part article with a fairly complex example.

Twilio.com. N. p., 2014. Web. 13 Feb. 2018.]] This example shows how to use twilio and websockets to let viewers decide what the next slide in a presentation will be.

** Flask Sockets
   This is a project from [[https://www.kennethreitz.org][Kenneth Reitz]], the guy who made [[http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/][requests]]. On the one hand, it looks much simpler, on the other it doesn't look like it has as many options. Maybe a good starter that would later need to be swapped out for Socket IO if it got complex enough.

   - [[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-websockets]["Using Websockets On Heroku With Python | Heroku Dev Center." Devcenter.heroku.com. N. p., 2018. Web. 13 Feb. 2018.]] This is a more complete example of how to use flask-sockets and deploy it on Heroku.

** Flask-uWSGI-Websocket
   [[https://github.com/zeekay/flask-uwsgi-websocket][This]] looks like it's halfway between flask-sockets and flask-socketIO.
