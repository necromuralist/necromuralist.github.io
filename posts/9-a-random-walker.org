* Beginning
  This is another post to see if I understand how to get [[https://p5js.org/][p5.js]] working in nikola. It's been a while since I tried and I just want to see if I remember how. This uses the random walk example from Daniel Schiffman's book /the Nature of Code/.

** A Div to Locate the Sketch
   The id of this div is set in the =p5.js= =setup= function as the parent of the sketch.

#+begin_src html
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="walker.js"></script>
<div id="random-walk-container">
</div>
#+end_src

#+begin_export html
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="walker.js"></script>
<div id="random-walk-container">
</div>
#+end_export

** The Javascript

#+INCLUDE: ../files/posts/a-random-walker/walker.js src js

* End
