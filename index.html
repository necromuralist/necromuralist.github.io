This seems better in a generalizable sense, but I think that the <code>findall</code> will build a list rather than a generator so might not be as efficient space-wise, and is probably slower. Others used the python string method - <code>count</code>. I think this problem is so easy that there's really not a lot of stuff you can do that doesn't overcomplicate things.</p>

<p>Although some sites tell you to set Firefox's <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code> option to true, it breaks altair's interaction and some other sites that use the canvas. It's probably better not to use that option, but if you do either:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toggle-resist-fingerprinting/">Toggle Resist Fingerprinting</a> extension and turn it off when things break (or just keep turning it off in <code>about:config</code>).</li>
<li>Or set <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting.autoDeclineNoUserInputCanvasPrompts</code> to False and accept the popup requests for the page you want to use.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2170595">
<p>I decided to give <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">altair</a>, the python data visualization library a try yesterday, just to see what it looked like. I ran their "hello, world" example and managed to get a plot.</p>
<object data="posts/mozilla-madness-resist-fingerprinting/test-bar-plot.html" height="800" style="width:100%" type="text/html">
<p>Figure Missing</p>
</object>
<p>Nothing fancy. If you move your cursor over the bars you might get a tool-tip giving you the width of the bar. If you do then you don't have the problem I ran into yesterday when I was trying it out. The image itself came out clear enough, but I couldn't figure out how to make the tool-tips work. I got desperate enough to try and read the documentation but it seems to be split between examples and API descriptions with little more in the way of explanatory documentation that would help to figure out how it was supposed to work. There are a lot of examples, though, so I decided to see if they would help, but then when I was looking at their <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_tooltips.html">Scatter Plot with Tool-tips</a> example I noticed that their plots didn't have tool-tips either, which seemed suspicious. Was their library that broken? Was the internet?</p>
<p>I took a look at the JavaScript console and that's when I saw these messages.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/mozilla-madness-resist-fingerprinting/blocked-canvas-data.png"></p>
<p>It looked like it might be important, but when I went searching for the message I couldn't find anything relevant. At least not at first.</p>

<h2 id="org7eefe30">Start With the Nuclear Option</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7eefe30">
<p>My first thought was that they had somehow made altair Chromium-only so I installed <a href="https://brave.com/">brave</a> and, sure enough, the tool-tips worked when I switched browsers. So my initial conclusion was that I'd have to switch browsers if I decided to use altair. But then it occurred to me that I'd had problems in the past with some sites and anti-tracking options turned on in firefox so maybe it had something to do with that or one of the extensions. The question was, what setting was it or what extension? I eventually decided it was too much work to figure out so I first tried to use <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/diagnose-firefox-issues-using-troubleshoot-mode">Troubleshoot Mode</a> to disable all the extensions, and when that didn't work, I did a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings">refresh</a> and wiped out all the customizations I'd done to firefox. Amazingly, this worked, but now I had to go about setting Firefox up again while avoiding whatever I did that broke altair.</p>

<h2 id="org22e8d8c">The Slow Crawl Back</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org22e8d8c">
<p>I decided to follow the advice on the <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/">restoreprivacy.com</a> page, just because it came up on the first page of my search results and it seemed to touch most of the bases that I'd run before this episode. As I did a step in the setup I would check back with the altair plot to make sure that the tool-tip was still working until, eventually, I came to the setting that broke it - <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/mozilla-madness-resist-fingerprinting/resist-fingerprinting.png"></p>
<p>When I set it to true the tool-tips would break and when I set it to false they would work again. So, then what? I didn't want to disable fingerprint protection, so I thought I'd do a little more searching and see if there was another way.</p>

</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgef66adc">
<h2 id="orgef66adc">Is It a Bug?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgef66adc">
<p>I decided to do a search on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Firefox">Bugzilla</a> and found what seemed like a relevant bug: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1631673">WhatsApp Web images broken if you flip `privacy.resistFingerprinting` due to canvas prompts without user interaction</a>. The discussion is about What's App and also mentions Instagram and Twitter, and although they are focused on images, the actual error seemed close enough to what I was seeing that it seemed like it might be the same or a similar thing. But the bug was opened two years ago, so if it is a bug it doesn't seem to be something they're eager to fix. Then I ran across this bug: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376865">Do not display Canvas Prompt unless triggered by user input</a> which discusses changing the default behavior to not prompt the user for permission to use the canvas. Now that I'm describing it I'm not sure how I came to this next step based on that bug, but for some reason I went looking in <code>about:config</code> again and noticed that right under <code>resistFingerprinting</code> was <code>resistFingerprinting.autoDeclineNoUserInputCanvasPrompts</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/mozilla-madness-resist-fingerprinting/auto-decline.png"></p>
<p>This option is set to True by default and seemed to be what they were talking about in the bug so I turned it off and went back to the altair page and this time when I put my cursor over the plot a popup came up asking me for permission.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/mozilla-madness-resist-fingerprinting/allow-dialog.png"></p>
<p>Once allowed it, it worked, even with <code>resistFingerprinting</code> set to true. So, if I understand what the bug reports were saying, what was causing the problem is that firefox is getting a request for the canvas but it decides that it isn't the user initiating it, so it needs extra permission but by default the box to ask for permission is turned off and the request is declined without the user (me) getting any feedback. This <i>seemed</i> like a bug.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this I remembered that a couple of days ago I went to the kindle cloud reader and one of the books wouldn't render. I went back and played with turning <code>resistFingerprinting</code> on and off before trying to load the ebook and this <i>was</i> apparently the culprit so it isn't just altair that's affected for me.</p>
<p>So it's a bug, right? It seemed like one, but there were already reports of this phenomena for other sites going back years so they appear to have done it on purpose. I was trying to figure out whether it was something that should be reported or not when I came upon this bug: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666160">Users enable `privacy.resistFingerprinting` and then are surprised when it causes problems</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/mozilla-madness-resist-fingerprinting/surprise-bug.png"></p>
<p>Despite the fact that I've seen multiple sites saying to enable this "feature" maybe it isn't really a good idea after all. In the near-term I installed the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toggle-resist-fingerprinting/">Toggle Resist Fingerprinting</a> extension and use it to turn <code>resistFingerprinting</code> on and off. To be honest, I'm not convinced that it really matters, I just got sucked into a trail of sites making conflicting assertions about what to do and convinced myself that I cared. At least I can read kindle books in the browser again.</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1c0e96f">
<p>I was trying to build one of my sites that uses <a href="https://nikola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">nikola</a> and this strange error came out saying that one of the shortcodes was getting the "site" argument multiple times. I had no idea what was going on and nikola doesn't pre-define the arguments to the shortcode-plugins (it parses the text and then passes the arguments along using the <code>*args</code> <code>**kwargs</code> convention) which makes it flexible, but figuring out a problem with the arguments is pretty tough, so I decided to turn to my old standby <code>PuDB</code>, which I've been using for so many years now, and is my favorite of the python debuggers I've tried.</p>
<p>I did my usual thing and found the line in the <code>nikola</code> code that was raising the error and inserted a breakpoint further up in the code.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"lancelot"</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">pudb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_trace</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I figured the problem was with my shortcode, named <code>lancelot</code>, and the conditional allowed me to skip all the other shortcodes being used. But then, when I ran the build (<code>nikola build -v2</code>)… disaster.</p>

<p>For some reason it wouldn't use the entire screen, making it impossible (or at least really hard) to read some of the variables that I wanted to check - and even worse, when I tried to open up the ipython terminal in it I got an error message.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/pudb-remote/pudb-ui-exception.png"></p>
<p>The error-message is one of those error-after-the-error messages that you sometimes run into. It was trying to notify me of an error by popping up some kind of dialog but then the dialog wouldn't open so it told me about the dialog error and didn't get around to telling me what the original error was. In any case, something was broken, so I had to resort to desperate measures - I went to read the documentation.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, <a href="https://documen.tician.de/pudb/index.html">there actually is some</a> (there wasn't really much when I first started using it).</p>

<h2 id="orgd21e824">Dead Ends</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd21e824">
<p>The first couple of things I tried seemed promising, but they didn't work.</p>

<h3 id="orgdf8a889">Another Screen</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdf8a889">
<p>There wasn't anything about re-sizing the window, but it did mention that you can have the output come out in a different terminal from the one where you run the code, so I gave it a go. I made a different screen and got its file-path using the <code>tty</code> command (<code>/dev/pts/6</code> in this case). Then I set an environment variable to hold the file-path in the screen where I was running the code (<code>set -x PUDB_TTY /dev/pts/6</code>). This caused <code>PuDB</code> to pipe the output to the next screen - and it <i>did</i> work to send the first PuDB output to the other screen, and it <i>did</i> use the whole window, but then it quit instead of letting me use the debugger. Not <i>quite</i> what I wanted, so I unset the environment variable and moved on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org3ad59ea">
<h3 id="org3ad59ea"><code>term_size</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3ad59ea">
<p>The documentation also showed how to use <code>PuDB</code> as a remote debugger, and in the example they passed in the argument <code>term_size</code> to <code>set_trace</code> so I thought, since the functions have the same name, that the <code>set_trace</code> I was using would take the same arguments. So I tried it.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pudb</span>
<span class="n">pudb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_trace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">term_size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">236</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">61</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Using the values that I had gotten from <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/tput">tput</a> using <code>tput cols</code> and <code>tput lines</code>. But that just raised an <code>ArgumentError</code>. The functions have the same name, but not the same arguments.</p>

<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgc3b9c53">
<h2 id="orgc3b9c53">Telnet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc3b9c53">
<p>So then I decided to try their remote version. It doesn't really make sense to me that it would work better than the regular version, but I didn't see any other choice. So instead of the usual code to insert a breakpoint I used:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pudb.remote</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">set_trace</span>
<span class="n">set_trace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">term_size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">236</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">61</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When I ran the build it stopped and told me to telnet into the localhost address at port 6899.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/pudb-remote/please-telnet.png"></p>
<p>So I changed into the other screen and ran telnet.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>telnet 127.0.0.1 6899
</pre></div>
<p>And what do you know.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/pudb-remote/pudb-fixed.png"></p>
<p>This turns out to not be a complete fix. Hitting <code>!</code> to get to the <code>ipython</code> terminal froze <code>PuDB</code>, but this was enough for me to inspect the variables and realize that I just needed to move one of the parameters in the definition of my shortcode method and it worked.</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org9ac8f3e">
<h2 id="org9ac8f3e">But It's Not Fixed?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9ac8f3e">
<p>Well, if this were a more intense debug I really would want the <code>ipython~/~ptipython</code> terminal, but since this is the first time I've tried to run <code>PuDB</code> under <code>KUbuntu's</code> <code>Konsole</code> instead of the <code>GNOME</code> terminal I'm hoping that just switching back to the other terminal will be enough - I'll have to test that once I'm more motivated.</p>

<p>I switch back and forth between Kubuntu and Ubuntu (Ubuntu seems to work better, but I like the aesthetics of Kubuntu) and one of the problems I had was that when I launched emacs in Kubuntu it had a permanent scrollbar in the center of the window that blocked out whatever text was there.</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/emacs-artifact-on-kubuntu/emacs-scrol-artifact.png"></p>
<p>It's more of an annoyance than anything else but since it doesn't happen on Ubuntu I figured I'd try and fix it. It took me a couple of different searches to find the answer so I thought I'd document it in case I need to remember this later.</p>

<p>This is the desktop that's causing the problem:</p>
<p><img alt="nil" src="posts/emacs-artifact-on-kubuntu/kubuntu-version.png"></p>
<p>It turns out that it's because my monitors are of different resolutions and in order to be able to read anything on the higher-resolution monitor I had to set the display scale to 200%, but this causes a problem with the scaling of the widgets (at least that's what it said on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/am64y8/bug_with_scrollbar_on_ubuntu_1804/">reddit</a> post where I found the solution).</p>

<h2 id="org57a0586">What is this about?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org57a0586">
<p>I've decided to try and build as much of the documentation that I use all the time on my local system, not just so that I'll have it if my internet connection goes down but also so that I won't be distracted by what's happening on the web. This is about building <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/">fastai's documentation</a>, which was a little trickier than I thought it would be so I decided it would be worth it to make a note for the future.</p>
<p>You can skip to the <a href="posts/building-fastais-documentation/#org07969b7">In A Nutshell</a> section of the post to get a summary of the steps without all the exposition that the middle section has.</p>

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org6d5d743">
<h3 id="org6d5d743">The Repository</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d5d743">
<p>The first thing I did was clone the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai">fastai git repository</a> from github. If you inspect it there's a folder called <code>docs_src</code> which seemed to logically mean that that's where the source files for the documentation are but when you go in there you won't find an <code>index.html</code> file, which seemed peculiar. There's a <code>Makefile</code> at the root of the repository so I inspected it and found that there's a rule:</p>
<pre class="example">
docs: $(SRC)
        rsync -a docs_src/ docs
        nbdev_build_docs
</pre>
<p>So I tried a naive <code>make docs</code> but of course it failed because there's nothing called <code>nbdev_build_docs</code>, so I searched online and found out that <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a> is a fastai project to make jupyter notebooks into a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Literate_programming">Literate Programming</a> system and that <code>nbdev_build_docs</code> is one of their command-line commands, so I installed it through pip:</p>
<pre class="example">
pip install nbdev
</pre>
<p>And re-ran the make command, which did nothing because the <code>rsync</code> command had already created the <code>docs</code> folder and for some reason this made the <code>nbdev_build_docs</code> command not work. So I removed the <code>docs</code> folder and re-ran it, which produced a big dump of errors because in converting the notebooks <code>nbdev</code> was importing a bunch of python code that wasn't installed. Interestingly, at this point the <code>docs</code> folder actually has enough to run the site, despite all the error-messages, but if you just try to load the files into a browser you can see that it's kind of broken, so then I went looking for what was going on.</p>

<h3 id="org34975d4">Jekyll and Hide</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org34975d4">
<p>For some reason I couldn't find anything in the documentation on building it, but searching for <i>"fastai build documentation"</i> brought an <a href="https://fastai1.fast.ai/gen_doc_main.html">outdated page</a> that tells you how to build the documentation but was written for the prior version of fastai (v1) so much of it doesn't make sense for v2 (e.g. it refers to a non-existent <code>tools</code> folder), which I didn't figure out at first because the sites for v1 and v2 don't really identify their version, except in the URL for the old site.</p>

<h4 id="org3d2042a">All You Need</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3d2042a">
<p>Reading that documentation it turns out that they're using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, so if you <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">install it</a> you just need to run Jekyll in the <code>docs</code> folder.</p>
<pre class="example">
cd docs
bundle exec jekyll serve
</pre>
<p>And the site is ready to read at <code>http://localhost:4000</code> and at this point you're good to go - but, of course, I didn't realize that and tried to fix the error messages first, which is what the rest of this post is about.</p>

<h3 id="orga85ad28">Fixing the Imports</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga85ad28">
<p>There's three things you need to do to fix the imports:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>install fastai and any dependencies</li>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/colour-science/flask-compress"><code>flask_compress</code></a></li>
<li>install <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python"><code>azureml-core</code></a></li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf438d64">
<p><a href="https://fastai1.fast.ai/gen_doc_main.html#step-2-setup">The old documentation</a> recommended installing it in development mode. I don't know if that's strictly necessary, but it fixed a lot of things so it seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>In the root of the fastai repository run pip.</p>
<pre class="example">
pip install -e ".[dev]"
</pre>
<p>This installs a lot of stuff so you might want to go get a cup of coffee (or maybe a cocktail) at this point while it does its thing. The <code>settings.ini</code> file lists the <code>dev_requirements</code> and the regular requirements if you want to see what needs to be installed in either case.</p>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6ea9a71">
<p>This wasn't quite so straight-forward, which is why I put it in a separate section. If you try to install it in Ubuntu 21.04 (or 20.04, etc.) you will get a big blob of error messages ending in this.</p>
<pre class="example">
ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1: /home/hades/.virtualenvs/fastai-clean/bin/python -u -c 'import io, os, sys, setuptools, tokenize; sys.argv[0] = '"'"'/tmp/pip-install-srnkqokl/ruamel-yaml_803314568

</pre>
<p>Which isn't really all that helpful. Scrolling up, it looks like the problem was with something called <a href="https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ruamel.yaml</a>, so investigating this seemed like a place to start, but, of course, the error messages are completely inscrutable now that I haven't programmed in C for so many years so I decided to search the web instead of trying to debug it directly, figuring that someone else must have had this problem.</p>
<p>This lead to a long search through various posts, but what it turned out to be was that both ruamel.yaml and azureml-core don't support python 3.9 yet (there are some <a href="https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+3.9">bug reports on GitHub</a> for it already) so you can't install it with the version that currently ships with Ubuntu (3.9.5) or anything above python 3.8.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org5d5a0ee"></a>The Fix<br>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org5d5a0ee">
<p>The fix I decided to use was to install <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> using their <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer">installer</a>. Once you run the installer and follow the rest of their <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation">installation instructiors</a> it's fairly straightforward to set up so I won't go into it.</p>
<p>I decided to use python 3.8.10 so to install it you do this:</p>
<pre class="example">
pyenv install 3.8.10
</pre>
<p>The only thing that didn't work for me was their <code>pyenv which</code> function which is supposed to show you the location of the python installation. The command might work but I couldn't figure out the arguments to use (updating the example they gave didn't work for me). It turned out the python binary was at:</p>
<pre class="example">
~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.10/bin/python
</pre>
<p>pyenv has it's own system for creating a virtual environment, but since I'm already using virtualfish and didn't want to try and troubleshoot yet another method I created a virtual environment the way I usually do it.</p>
<pre class="example">
~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.10/bin/python -m venv fastai-doc
</pre>
<p>At this point I activated the new virtual environment and had to re-do previous installation steps (for <code>fastai</code> and <code>flask_compress</code>) as well as the azure-ml installation.</p>
<pre class="example">
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pip install flask-compress azureml-core
</pre>
<p>The installation of fastai installs <code>nbdev</code> as one of the requirements so that didn't have to be re-done. And now I built the documentation and ran the jekyll server. Easy-peasy.</p>
<pre class="example">
make docs
cd docs
bundle exec jekyll serve

<p>Programming is difficult for some people to learn because the concepts are abstract and while there have been efforts to make them more concrete, efforts that focused either on telling stories (e.g. picture books and adventure comics) or transforming the code into something more tangible (e.g. manipulating physical blocks or using graphic representations to create programs) but these prior works didn't make the step from the concrete systems they created to actual code so this team created and tested a system (Coding Strips) to develop comics that could be directly tied to real code.</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org718c767">
<p>This is a re-working of the <a href="posts/coding-strip/">Coding Strip</a> Recursion example. Not because I can do it better, but because I've never done one before so stealing their idea seems like an easier way to start. In the original they had a comic showing a character who wants to buy a ticket but there's a long line so she asks the person in front of her how many people are in front of him, and he asks the person in front of him, and so on. They then followed up the comics with some code that translated the comic to a concrete function.</p>

<h2 id="org965482a">What is this about?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org965482a">
<p>I made a previous post (<a href="posts/enabling-wake-on-lan/">Enabling Wake-On-LAN (In Ubuntu 20.10)</a>) about enabling Wake-On-LAN on my server, but it didn't seem to work after a re-boot. I looked in the logs using <a href="https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a> and noticed that the <code>wol.service</code> that I set up didn't get enabled after the re-boot. I thought about it and I remembered that when I was working with bluetooth and set up a service for it I had to make it wait for the bluetooth service to start first or it wouldn't work and realized that there was nothing in the <code>wol.service</code> file to tell it to wait so I went poking around and found what I hope to be a fix.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org00649a9">
<h2 id="org00649a9">So, how do you do it?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org00649a9">
<p>We need to update the <code>/etc/systemd/system/wol.service</code> that I created in that earlier post. Previously it looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>[Unit]
Description=Enable Wake On Lan

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart = /sbin/ethtool --change enp4s0 wol g

[Install]
WantedBy=basic.target
</pre></div>
<p>We need to update the <code>[Unit]</code> section by adding</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>Requires=network.target
After=network.target
</pre></div>
<p>To let systemd know that we don't want this to run until after the network service has run. I also changed the <code>WantedBy</code> to <code>multi-user.target</code>. So the updated file looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>[Unit]
Description=Enable Wake On Lan
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart = /sbin/ethtool --change enp4s0 wol g

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</pre></div>
<p>Now reload the daemon and re-enable it.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable wol.service
</pre></div>
<p>To make sure I didn't introduce any errors I ran it once.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo systemctl start wol
</pre></div>
<p>Then I rebooted it.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo reboot now
</pre></div>
<p>This time in journalctl I saw this:</p>
<pre class="example">
Dec 07 00:02:17 erebus systemd[1]: Finished Enable Wake On Lan.
Dec 07 00:02:17 erebus systemd[1]: wol.service: Succeeded.
</pre>
<p>And running <code>ethtool</code> showed that it was enabled.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>Wake-on: g
</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orga05105d">

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga05105d">
<p>Well, insofar as it's working now, yes. But since I change more than one thing I don't really know exactly what did it (was it one of the three lines I changed or all of them?). Anyway, since it works I'll let it lie for now.</p>

<li>The Arch wiki has a page on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wake-on-LAN">Wake-On-LAN</a> that tells you many different ways to set it up – I copied the systemd file almost exactly.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org53da148">
<p>This is how to mount a LUKS encrypted drive with <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/cryptsetup.8.html">cryptsetup</a> in Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla). My use-case is I have a headless server that has an external USB drive that's encrypted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">LUKS</a> that I need to mount from the command line. I like the flexibility it gives a little more than the what the Gnome GUI does so I'll probably use it on my desktop as well. I previously documented how to do it with <a href="http://storaged.org/doc/udisks2-api/latest/udisksctl.1.html">udiskctl</a> in <a href="posts/mounting-an-encrypted-usb-drive/">this post</a> but I like <code>cryptsetup</code> a little better. This assumes that you know the partition/device (in my case it's <code>/dev/sdb1</code>). That previous post shows how I found it so I'll just do the decrypting and mounting here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orga634585">
<h2 id="orga634585">So, How Do You Do It?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga634585">
<p>The syntax to decrypt the device is:</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo cryptsetup open &lt;device&gt; &lt;name&gt;
</pre>
<p>As I mentioned above, in this case my <code>device</code> is <code>/dev/sdb1</code>. The name can be an arbitrary one (although there are limitiations on special characters so let's say it can be any alpha-numeric name) and I'll use <code>wddata</code> as the name. Then my command to decrypt the drive is:</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdb1 wddata
</pre>
<p>This will prompt you for your password and then the encryption passphrase. Once the command succeeds, it adds a link in <code>/dev/mapper</code> using the name you passed in so you can mount the device (assuming the directory you want to mount it in exists) like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo mount /dev/mapper/wddata /media/data
</pre>
<p>Where <code>wddata</code> is the name I told <code>cryptsetup</code> to use and <code>/media/data</code> is a directory that I had previously created.</p>

</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgaa1bef2">
<h2 id="orgaa1bef2">Source</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaa1bef2">
<p>Besides the man-page for <code>cryptsetup</code> on my server, I was pointed to use <code>cryptsetup</code> from this StackOverflow post:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/63594/mount-encrypted-volumes-from-command-line">https://askubuntu.com/questions/63594/mount-encrypted-volumes-from-command-line</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The accepted answer uses <code>udiskctl</code> but further down is an answer by George Schölly using <code>cryptsetup</code>. The syntax in the answer is the older <code>cryptsetup</code> syntax (which should still work) so it doesn't look exactly like what I used.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The systemd configuration here isn't quite right, but since this post is kind of long and convoluted I made a standalone update about the systemd configuration file in <a href="posts/using-systemd-to-enable-wake-on-lan/">this post</a>.</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb536b95">
<p>These are my notes on getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN">Wake-On-LAN</a> working in Ubuntu 20.10. I have a server that I use to run most of the computation on when I use emacs/jupyter but I have it in a corner upstairs and although it's only a little walk, I find that the fact that I have to stop what I'm doing and go upstairs to push that little button on the front makes me lazy and so it ends up running more than it has to so I thought I'd enable Wake-On-LAN so I can suspend it and wake it up whenever I need to. I'm only going to use suspend (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface">APM</a> S3). When I tried to use hibernate (S4) it ended up shutting down my machine (S5). Interestingly, my BIOS menu has an option to enable waking up from shutdown, but since my disk is encrypted, and I didn't set up a separate SSH server, I have to go enter the passphrase to unlock the disk before the operating system can boot up, so it kind of defeats its own purpose.</p>

<h3 id="orgb540722">Ethtool</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb540722">
<p>The command I used to set up Wake-On-LAN on the remote machine is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethtool">ethtool</a>. It's in the Ubuntu repositories but wasn't installed on my machine so I had to add it.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo apt install ethtool
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org72d3fc6">
<h3 id="org72d3fc6">Checking the Interface</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org72d3fc6">
<p>From what I've read, not all ethernet interfaces support Wake-On-LAN (although I've never seen one that doesn't) so a quick check might be useful. First, find the name of your ethernet interface.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>ip a
</pre></div>
<p>My machine shows four interfaces so I'll just show the output for the interface I'm interested in rather than the whole output for the command.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>2: enp4s0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 38:d5:47:79:ab:0b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.86.97/24 brd 192.168.86.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0
       valid_lft 84752sec preferred_lft 84752sec
    inet6 fe80::685d:374d:a577:f787/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
</pre></div>
<p>Ethtool uses the name of the interface, in this case it's <code>enp4s0</code>, so we'll need to note that. Additionally, the machine that I used to wake up the machine needs the MAC address (<code>38:d5:47:79:ab:0b</code>) so it'd be useful to write that down someplace. I'm waking it up from the LAN so the IP address isn't so important, and to be able to SSH into it I need to know it anyway, so it's really those two pieces of information that I need. Now to check if it supports Wake-On-LAN.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo ethtool enp4s0
</pre></div>
<p>Ethtool will give you some information if you don't run it as root but for Wake-On-LAN you need to run it as root. The important lines in the output is near the bottom and it looks something like this if it supports Wake-On-LAN.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>Supports Wake-on: pumbg
Wake-on: d
</pre></div>
<p>The man-page for <code>ethtool</code> tell you what that cryptic <code>pumbg</code> means - the letters are different options that this interface supports for Wake-On-LAN. In this case they are:</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" frame="hsides" rules="groups">
<colgroup>
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left"></colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="org-left" scope="col">Option</th>
<th class="org-left" scope="col">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">p</td>
<td class="org-left">Wake on PHY activity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">u</td>
<td class="org-left">Wake on unicast messages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">m</td>
<td class="org-left">Wake on multicast messages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">b</td>
<td class="org-left">Wake on broadcast messages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">g</td>
<td class="org-left">Wake on MagicPacket messages</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There's an additional option which is what the interface was set on – <code>d</code> – as you can see in the last line of the output. This means <i>Disable (wake on nothing). This option clears all previous options.</i> I don't have many devices on my network, so I don't know that there's a lot of broadcasts, multicasts, etc. that would be waking it up all the time, but since one feature of Wake-On-LAN is that it only wakes the machine when it gets the "Magic Packet", only the <code>g</code> and <code>d</code> options matter. Now that I knew it was supported, it was time to try it out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orga86fca7">
<h3 id="orga86fca7">Turn It On Temporarily</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga86fca7">
<p>The <code>ethtool</code> will turn on Wake-On-LAN, but (supposedly) everytime you reboot the machine it will reset to disabled. I haven't really tested this out, but I'll document how to make it permanent later, anyway.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo ethtool --change enp4s0 wol g
</pre></div>
<p>So, as you might guess, we changed the Wake-On-LAN setting to listen for MagicPacket messages. You can check using the ethtool again.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo ethtool enp4s0
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>Wake-on</code> line should have changed to:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>Wake-on: g
</pre></div>
<p>Now to suspend the machine so we can test it out.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo systemctl suspend
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org2482918">
<h3 id="org2482918">Test It Out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2482918">
<p>Now, on my local machine I needed to install <a href="https://github.com/jpoliv/wakeonlan">wakeonlan</a>. There's a surprising number of programs to send the Magic Packet, but this just happened to be the one I used.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo apt install wakeonlan
</pre></div>
<p>The default way to use <code>wakeonlan</code> is apparently to just pass it the MAC address of the computer to wake up, and it will send the Magic Packet out as a broadcast, so that's what I did.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>wakeonlan 38:d5:47:79:ab:0b
</pre></div>
<p>And then I pinged the machine and I waited. And I waited. And I waited… Eventually I went upstairs and saw that it was still sleeping so I pushed the power button to wake it up and went back downstairs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org04762b2">
<h3 id="org04762b2">Take Two</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04762b2">
<p>Something wasn't right so I SSHd into the server and started up <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a> to see if the packets were going through.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo tcpdump -i enp4s0 '(udp and port 7) or (udp and port 9)'
</pre></div>
<p>Which gave me this output:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on enp4s0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
</pre></div>
<p>And then I sent the Magic Packet again.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>wakeonlan 38:d5:47:79:ab:0b
</pre></div>
<p>…And nothing happened. For some reason the packets weren't getting picked up by the machine. Luckily, <code>wakeonlan</code> lets you pass in an IP address as an option. The man page recommends using a broadcast address, but I have the IP addresses of my machines on the LAN reserved on my router/access-point so I just passed in the full address (I did try the LAN broadcast and it worked too).</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>wakeonlan -i erebus 38:d5:47:79:ab:0b
</pre></div>
<p>I have my machine's IP address aliased in my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file so <code>erebus</code> is just an alias for the machine's IP address. The subnet broadcast version looked like this.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>wakeonlan -i 192.168.86.255 38:d5:47:79:ab:0b
</pre></div>
<p>The output from <code>tcpdump</code> for the first packet looked like this.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on enp4s0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
20:47:11.689587 IP 192.168.86.141.34805 &gt; erebus.discard: UDP, length 102
</pre></div>
<p>So, something was different. I suspended the machine again and sent the Magic Packet and this time it worked. Go figure.</p>

<h4 id="org20a840b">Set It Up</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org20a840b">
<p>The reasons that I said earlier that the Wake-On-LAN setting "supposedly" is temporary is that:</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I haven't really re-booted that machine to test it out (I have rebooted, but I haven't disable the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> service that I'm documenting here).</li>
<li>The machine that I'm typing this on had Wake-On-LAN enabled and it doesn't have a <code>systemd</code> service enabled.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, really, I don't remember even enabling Wake-On-LAN on this machine so maybe it just was the default and I didn't realise it… another thing I should look into one of these days. Anyway, to make a service that always enables Wake-On-LAN the first step is to find the path to <code>ethertool</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>which ethtool
</pre></div>
<p>In my case the path was <code>/sbin/ethtool</code>, so once you know this you can create a file at <code>/etc/systemd/system/wol.service</code> (I think you can use another systemd sub-folder, and you can name the file anything you want, within reason, but this one seems to work well enough). In this file you put settings that look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>[Unit]
Description=Enable Wake On Lan

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart = /sbin/ethtool --change enp4s0 wol g

[Install]
WantedBy=basic.target
</pre></div>
<p>The only thing specific to my machine is <code>enp4s0</code>, the name of the ethernet interface, although it's possible that the path to the <code>ethtool</code> executable might be different too… but it should be the same on Ubuntu 20.10, anyway.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-4" id="outline-container-orgc3eb398">
<h4 id="orgc3eb398">Enable The Service</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc3eb398">
<p>To enable it you can do this:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable wol.service
</pre></div>
<p>Where <code>wol.service</code> is the name of the file you created with the settings. You can check its status if you want.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>systemctl status wol
</pre></div>
<p>And that's that.</p>
</div>
