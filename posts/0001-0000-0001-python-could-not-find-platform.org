I was going to make my first nikola post in a few months but when I
tried the =nikola new_post= command I got the following error.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
    Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
    Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]
    Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
    ImportError: No module named 'encodings'
#+END_SRC

I had no idea what this meant so I tried searching the web for the error
and found people saying different things about what it meant to them
when they encountered it, but the one that pointed the way for me was a
[[https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/161][bug report for
virtualenv]] where a user reported that he got this error because, it
turned out, the Windows version didn't work with symlinks if the window
was opened as an administrator.

I'm not using Windows, but when I changed into the directory for my
nikola virtualenv installation, =ls -l= showed that all my symbolic
links were broken. I don't know how it happened... maybe something got
moved, but the point of this post was to make a note for myself if I see
this error again - check the sym-links for the virtualenv installation.
