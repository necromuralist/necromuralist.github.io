* The Problem
Given a string, count the number of vowels in it. The vowels are "aeiou" and the letters will be lower-cased.

* The Solution
** The Tests
#+begin_src python :results none
# pypi
from expects import equal, expect

expect(vowel_count("a")).to(equal(1))
expect(vowel_count("rmnl")).to(equal(0))
expect(vowel_count("a mouse is not a house")).to(equal(10))
#+end_src

** The Function
#+begin_src python :results none
VOWELS = set("aeiou")

def vowel_count(letters: str) -> int:
    """Counts the number of vowels in the input
    
    Args:
     letters: lower-cased string to check for vowels
    
    Returns:
     count of vowels in the letters
    """
    return sum(1 for letter in letters if letter in VOWELS)
#+end_src

* Alternatives
[[https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/54ff37ee355cfd937000105c/groups/54ff8310c50295aa890004d3][One solution]] used regular expressions and the ~findall~ method. This seems better in a generalizable sense, but I think that the ~findall~ will build a list rather than a generator so might not be as efficient space-wise, and is probably slower. Others used the python string method - ~count~. I think this problem is so easy that there's really not a lot of stuff you can do that doesn't overcomplicate things.

Anyway, day one.
