This is one way that you can memorize binary states - not just binary number, since you can encode the binary states as binary numbers.

1. Encode as bits (e.g. /white=0/, /black=1/)
2. Arrange the bits into 3x3 grids - 3 bits per row, 3 rows per grid
    
  \[
  000\\
  110\\
  101\\
  \]

3. Convert each row to decimal numbers.

  \[
  000 = 0\\
  110 = 6\\
  101 = 5\\
  \]

4. Convert the decimal to a word-image using a system. In the case of the Major System you might get /065 = sgl = seagull/.

6. Repeat until you have all the bits covered

7. Put the images into a Memory Palace, two images per location.
