* Collections of Links
  - [[https://hadoopilluminated.com/hadoop_illuminated/Public_Bigdata_Sets.html][Hadoop Illuminated]] - Part of an online book about hadoop.
* Miscellaneous
  - [[https://github.com/norvig/pytudes][Peter Norvig's Pytudes]] - Covers a range of topics, but I found it via a link to the Probablity section so it's ending up here.
