This is a type of Mnemonic Peg System that helps you memorize lists using a pre-built Peg List based on the alphabet. It doesn't have to be the alphabet, it can be any ordered list of words that you already have memorized.

First you created a list of words wherein the first letter of each word matches the letters of the alphabet - /Ape, Bat, Crane/, etc. Now whenever you need to memorize a list you associate each item on the list with a word in the alphabet list in order. So if you need to memorize /a loaf of bread, a container of milk, and a stick of butter/ you would do something like this:

| Abecadarium | List              | Link                                                                 |
|-------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ape         | Loaf of Bread     | King Kong climbing the Empire State Building holding a loaf of bread |
| Bat         | Container of Milk | Supermarket milk jug with a bat in it                                |
| Crane       | Stick of Butter   | A crane choking on a giant stick of butter                           |

Once you've made the associations you can remember the list by starting with Ape and working through the alphabet.
