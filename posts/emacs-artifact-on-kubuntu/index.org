* What's this then?
  I switch back and forth between Kubuntu and Ubuntu (Ubuntu seems to work better, but I like the aesthetics of Kubuntu) and one of the problems I had was that when I launched emacs in Kubuntu it had a permanent scrollbar in the center of the window that blocked out whatever text was there.

It's more of an annoyance than anything else but since it doesn't happen on Ubuntu I figured I'd try and fix it. It took me a couple of different searches to find the answer so I thought I'd document it in case I need to remember this later.
* The Cause

This is the desktop that's causing the problem:

It turns out that it's because my monitors are of different resolutions and in order to be able to read anything on the higher-resolution monitor I had to set the display scale to 200%, but this causes a problem with the scaling of the widgets (at least that's what it said on the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/am64y8/bug_with_scrollbar_on_ubuntu_1804/][reddit]] post where I found the solution).
* The Fix

The fix for me was to edit the =~/.local/share/applications/emacs.desktop= file so that the EXEC line read:

#+begin_example bash
Exec= /usr/bin/env GDK_SCALE= emacs
#+end_example

Once this was in place the artifact went away.
