* Introduction
  I recently started revisiting some [[https://vuejs.org/][vue.js]] code that I was working on at work and when I ran the unit-tests all of them failed with pretty much the same error.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
actual.should.equal is not a function. (In 'actual.should.equal(expected)', 'actual.should.equal' is an instance of ProxyObject)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I'm using the [[http://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should][chai BDD 'should']] style of testing, so this /should/ have worked (because it was working before). To debug it I ran it with FireFox and when I did, all the tests mysteriously started working. It turns out I was using [[http://phantomjs.org/][PhantomJS]], which [[https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344][has been abandoned]], and somewhere along the line something in chai stopped working with it, so I decided to set up Firefox headless as my browser instead. This is how I did it.
* Set Up
** Install the plugin
   I already had this installed for debugging, but I'll mention it anyway, for completeness.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
npm install karma-firefox-launcher --save-dev
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Set it up in Karma
   I'm running the tests using [[https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html][karma]] and I had hoped that I would just have to change the name of the browser in the configuration, but it turns out to need a little setup in the =karma.conf.js= file. First get rid of the =PhantomJS= reference. Delete this:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
browsers: ['PhantomJS'],
#+END_SRC

and replace it with this.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
browsers: ['FirefoxHeadless'],
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =FirefoxHeadless= browser isn't actually defined, so you have to add it (I put it right after the =browsers= declaration).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
customLaunchers: {
      'FirefoxHeadless': {
        base: 'Firefox',
        flags: [
          '-headless',
        ],
      }
    },
#+END_EXAMPLE

This tells karma to run =firefox= and pass in the =-headless= flag, as shown in the Mozilla documentation about [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Headless_mode#Using_headless_mode][firefox's headless mode]]. I found out how to do it from [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46779498/running-karma-tests-in-headless-firefox-browser-not-working-on-jenkins][a question on Stack Overflow]].
* Conclusion
  =PhantomJS= breaks the Chai's BDD style of testing, but since both Firefox and [[https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md][Chrome]] have headless modes, using them instead makes it work without actually needing to have the GUI launch.
