#+END_COMMENT

* Introduction
  I'm connecting to a remote network using [[https://openvpn.net/][OpenVPN]] served by an ASUS access point. I originally did it at the command line.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn
#+END_EXAMPLE

It turns out that this doesn't allow me to access anything outside of the network that I was connecting to. From what I can tell it's a DNS problem, but nothing I found about fixing DNS problems with OpenVPN from the command line worked. Luckily the Network Settings GUI works, but even then, it didn't work out of the box.

* Initial Configuration
  First, not everything you need is installed. Besides the openvpn client itself (which I had installed before trying to run it at the command line) you need some things for the network settings as well.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now open the network settings.

In the window that pops up click on the + sign to add a connection.

In the window that then pops up click on =Import from file...= (I'm assuming you are using a config file).

Navigate to the config file, and double-click on it. In the dialog that pops up enter whatever extra information you need. In my case it was the username and password.

Click on the green 'Add' button and you should now have an entry for your VPN connection in the network settings. Click on the on switch (initially labeled 'Off') and if you're lucky it will connect.

After you click on the switch it will look like this, but read on just in case it didn't.

* Fixing the Password Problem

Unfortunately for me it didn't connect. In =/var/log/syslog= I could see entries like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gnome-shell[2805]: Invalid VPN service type (cannot find authentication binary)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I don't know if the message is directly telling you this (it doesn't seem to), but it turns out that for some reason the Network Settings doesn't save your password. Look in =/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/= for a file that matches the name you gave your vpn in the settings. In my case it was just called 'client'. Open it as root in an editor.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo emacs /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/client
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then change this line in the =[vpn]= section:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
password-flags=1
#+END_EXAMPLE

to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
password-flags=0
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then add this section.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[vpn-secrets]
password="your-password"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where ="your-password"= is your vpn password. /The quotation marks around your password are required./

* Now Really Connect
  First restart the network manager.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo service network-manager restart
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now re-open the network settings and click on the switch again. With any luck this time it will stay on and you can check by going to one of the devices on your VPN network.
