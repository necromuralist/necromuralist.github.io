<html><body><p>I have a <a href="http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail/1/hl2140/Overview">Brother HL-2140 Laser Printer </a>which was working previously but for some reason gave me a CUPs error when I tried to print today (I think this was the first time I'd tried to print since upgrading to Ubuntu 14.10). I searched for the error on the web and found this <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1748457">forum post</a> that didn't address my problem directly but did address a problem I had when I set up my printer before (on Ubuntu 14.04, I'm using 14.10 now) where the printer would churn out blank pages instead of printing what I wanted so I decided to give it a try again. There are a few suggestions on the page but the two I tried both suggested using a different driver. <br><br>The first suggestion I tried was to use the <i>HL-2170</i> instead of the <i>HL-2140.</i> This worked when I printed the first test page but after that it just silently failed no matter what I tried to install.<br><br>The next suggestion I tried was to use the <i>Brother HL-2140 Foomatic/hpijs-pcl5e</i> driver. This didn't print any pages for me and gave a `Idle - filter failed` error in the printer properties dialogue box. I don't know what the message means, but since I fixed it without knowing, I guess I don't need to know.<br><br>Sandwiched between the <i>HL-2170</i> and the <i>HL-2140</i> models in the list of available drivers was the <i>HL-2142</i> model. Since it seemed close enough to the 2140 (only off by two) I decided to try it and for whatever reason it worked. I'm pretty sure I used one of drivers the forum post suggested when I was using 14.04 (and the default <i>HL-2140*</i>driver before that) but something seems to have changed again.<br><br>There's two lessons here:<br><br>  1. Use the <i>HL-2142</i> driver for the <i>Brother HL-2140</i> printer on Ubuntu 14.10<br>  2. Try drivers for similar models if you upgrade your Ubuntu installation and the printer stops working<br></p></body></html>
