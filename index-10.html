<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org831bc70">
<p>One of the problems of relying on search engines is that the more obscure the subject you are interested in, the greater the chance that what you'll get will be either unlocatable or outdated. These are my notes on setting up the <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth">ubertooth</a> on an ubuntu system in September of 2018, which turned out to be a slightly different experience from what I went through earlier in this year so I thought I should try and make a record of it somewhere.</p>

<h2 id="orga491769">The Current Release</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga491769">
<p>The current release for the Ubertooth firmware and code is <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/releases/tag/2018-08-R1">2018-08-R1</a>. Download the <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/releases/download/2018-08-R1/ubertooth-2018-08-R1.tar.xz">ubertooth-2018-08-R1.tar.xz</a> file from that page and untar it. You will also want the matching <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/libbtbb/releases/tag/2018-08-R1">libbtb</a> code.</p>

<h2 id="org336f994">Building and Installing the Code</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org336f994">
<p>For some reason the instructions on the home page assume you already have the code built and installed, but there's <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/wiki/Build-Guide">actually some previous steps you need to do</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org0e7ffa1">
<h3 id="org0e7ffa1">Install the Dependencies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0e7ffa1">
<pre class="example">
sudo apt install cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev make gcc g++ libbluetooth-dev \
pkg-config libpcap-dev python-numpy python-pyside python-qt4
</pre>
<p>The <code>python-&lt;packages&gt;</code> can be downloaded from pip, and you really don't need the <code>pyside</code> and <code>qt4</code> libraries unless you want to run the spectral scanner, which is kind of their hello-world, which is nice, but the pyside code is actually depracated because qt5 is the current version and it won't work with python 3.6 (the current ubuntu default) so I personally would skip it. <code>numpy</code> is always a good idea no matter what you end up doing.</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1fd20b5">
<p>One of the commands installed in the previous step was <code>ubertooth-dfu</code> which is the <b>Do Firmware Update</b> command that we need to update the firmware. First insert the ubertooth USB dongle, then change into the <code>ubertooth-2018-08-R1/ubertooth-one-firmware-bin</code> folder and run the update command.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> According to the documentation you need to make sure to have an antenna on the ubertooth before inserting it. Also, it too a couple of attempts inserting, removing, and re-inserting the ubertooth before it worked for some reason (you can tell it's ready when there are two green LEDs and one red LED lit up).</p>
<pre class="example">
ubertooth-dfu -d bluetooth_rxtx.dfu -r
</pre>
<p>As I mentioned before, the GUI for the spectral analysis is out of date and didn't install in my setup, but you can check that the ubertooth is working by just running the spectral analysis without a GUI.</p>
<pre class="example">
ubertooth-specan
</pre>
<p>This should send a timestamp, frequency, RSSI CSV to stdout as the ubertooth sweeps the channels and shows the amount of electromagnetic radiation it sees on each.</p>

<h2 id="org31f3276">Spectools</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org31f3276">
<p>Since we can't run the python spectrum analyzer, we should turn to a better alternative, <a href="https://www.kismetwireless.net/spectools/">spectools</a>. This was a project to mostly re-create the <a href="https://www.metageek.com/products/wi-spy/">metageek wi-spy GUI</a> but it supports the ubertooth. It actually looks like a dead project (the last <i>News</i> item on their site was from 2012), but it works for now. Luckily ubuntu has this in the repositories so you should be able to just install it with apt.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo apt install spectools
</pre>
<p>Once you install it you can either run <code>spectool_curses</code> which will run at the command line but only has one view, or <code>spectool_gtk</code> which will run in an X-windows environment and show three views of the 2.4 GHz spectrum.</p>

<h2 id="org839baa7">Kismet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org839baa7">
<p>Now we come to the interesting installation. At this point you probably have all the command-line utilities you need, but kismet provides a convenient interface to start capturing packets. Unfortunately it is going through a major upgrade which makes it incompatible with the ubertooth plugin for it (maybe, there's two plugins and one of them might work, but they don't seem to document it (or much else, for that matter)).</p>

<h2 id="org96cde19">The Prowler</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org96cde19">
<p>I came home the other day to find some things from my garage outside on the driveway. The garage door was closed but the bolt wasn't in place, so I guess I forgot to secure it and someone went in while I was at work. I have two Arlo security cameras, one pointing at my front lawn and one at my back (I just took the ones I had set up to catch intruders and pointed them outside so they aren't really set up correctly) and they are supposed to send me notifications when motion is detected, but I didn't recall seeing any, but then I looked at my phone and I had missed one earlier in the day, and when I looked at it there was a video showing someone standing outside my back door, but that was all, but I have a Continuous Video Recording (CVR) subscription so I decided to poke around, that's when I found out how horrible Arlo's CVR really is.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orga63fe01">
<h2 id="orga63fe01">The Problem with Arlo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga63fe01">
<p>The first problem with the Arlo's CVR system is that it's not always reliable. I've had cameras randomly stop recording videos on the server and the only "fix" that the help desk was able to give me was to deauthorize and reauthorize them (and in some cases completely remove them from the base-station and re-add them). This seems to work, but whenever you deauthorize a camera the server dumps all your recordings, so if you think you want to save something you'll have to do that first or it won't be there when the camera gets re-authorized. But then if you try to save something you'll find that the Arlo doesn't provide a way to download the video. The work-around you'll find on the forums is to do a screen capture while it plays - a horrible system, especially since the flash interface is pretty flaky and doesn't always work on my PC.</p>
<p>Then there's a secondary problem in that it's recording twenty-four hours a day - and they don't have a fast-forward button. They do have a timeline that you can click on to jump around, not only does this mean you might be jumping past events you want, but they don't really have a 'streaming' interface in the sense that Netflix or some other streaming service does where they're downloading small chunks so you don't have to wait a long time for the play to resume, instead the Arlo seems to be downloading one minute at a time so you have these really long waits, and the precision of the timeline isn't very good so you'll probably have to search a little bit just to find what you want.</p>
<p>There's also another problem, which is that the user-interface's timeline isn't accurate, so even if you know the time of an event, you can't use the time in the interface to find it. In my case the bit that was captured on my phone showing the trespasser gave me a time, and there was a little blue dot on the timeline showing that there was an event at that time, but there was nothing in the video. It turned out that the video for the camera I had out back was shifted fifty-five minutes into the future, which was even more confusing because the time for the camera I had in front wasn't shifted (that I know of) so when I looked at the video for the front around that time I <i>was</i> able to see the prowler arriving.</p>
<p>But even once I found the places in the CVR that showed the prowler (I didn't have it pointing at my garage so I didn't see him actually doing anything other than probing (knocking and then trying to open the doors)) I still had the problem of how to get the video before Netgear decided to break again and I lost it all. This is where python came in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org9972834">
<h2 id="org9972834">The Python Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9972834">
<p>It turns out that even though netgear hasn't published an official API for the Arlo, some people (<a href="http://www.robertogallea.com/blog/netgear-arlo-api">like this guy</a>) have reverse-engineered the API and there are several python-based libraries on github that help you talk to the arlo. This <a href="https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo">one</a>, by <i>jeffreydwalter</i> was the one that I saw that helped with downloading the CVR videos so it's the one that I went with. It's on pypi, but the commit that added CVR support was made a month ago and I wasn't sure when the pypi code was uploaded so I decided to install it from the master branch, since I was going to use the example code to start my code anyway - by this I mean I had to pull the repository anyway, so I used the <code>setup.py</code> file to install it (in developer mode in case it changes).</p>
<p>The following code is basically what you can find in the example that comes with the repository called <a href="https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo/blob/master/examples/arlo-cvrdownload.py">arlo-cvrdownload.py</a> re-written to have a command-line interface and match my coding style more.</p>

<p><code>dotenv</code> works by adding the values in the configuration file into the environment dictionary. Most of the convenience of it comes if you create a <code>.env</code> file at the base of your repository, in which case it will automatically find it for you, but even though I'm not doing that it still saves me from parsing the file myself, so I'll use it. Since the other properties (<code>username</code> and <code>password</code>) rely on the values already being in the dictionary I'm calling <code>load_dotenv</code> in the <code>config_path</code> setter so that it's there before they get used.</p>

<p>For a consumer product this seems like a lot of work to download videos, but I'm glad someone went to the trouble to build this to make up for Netgear's horrible user interface. The Arlo seems like some decent (although probably overpriced) hardware matched to some pretty bad software and nearly non-existent customer support or documentation and a not particularly robust web-service. I don't know that I would recommend it to anyone who wants more than a web-camera.</p>

<h2 id="orgb8fc63f">The Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb8fc63f">
<p>If you use underscores in org-mode it will treat them almost the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#Versions">latex</a> does, changing the text that immediately follows the underscore as a sub-string.</p>
<p>This:</p>
<pre class="example">
before-the-underscore_aftertheunderscore
</pre>
<p>Is rendered as this:</p>
<p>before-the-underscore<sub>aftertheunderscore</sub></p>
<p>But sometimes you just want an underscore (especially if you are writing about python code).</p>

<h2 id="orge7a1849">Stack Overflow to the Rescue (Again)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge7a1849">
<p>I found the answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/698562/disabling-underscore-to-subscript-in-emacs-org-mode-export">on Stack Overflow</a> (of course) - you can add an <code>#+OPTIONS</code> directive to the file to disable this behavior. I originally went with the accepted answer which was to add <code>#+OPTIONS: ^:nil</code>, and it works in most cases, but then I couldn't figure out how to write this post, since the underscores stopped working and I didn't want to have to use MathJax to show what I meant (although maybe that wouldn't be so bad), so now I think the better answer is the one given by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/60183/danielpoe">danielpoe</a> in the comments - use <code>#+OPTIONS: ^:{}</code> instead. This disables the sub-scripting behavior of the underscore in most cases but allows you to add sub-scripting by putting the text following the underscore in curly-braces.</p>
<p>I wrote the example above, for instance, like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
before-the-underscore_{aftertheunderscore}
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org0181db8">
<h2 id="org0181db8">A Final Note</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0181db8">
<p>This solution doesn't replicate the original org-mode behavior completely when you use the curly-braces. Without the directive if you have multiple underscores org-mode puts everything after the first underscore in the sub-string and removes all subsequent underscores, smashing the words together.</p>
<p>When I wrote this:</p>
<pre class="example">
before-the-underscore_after_the_under_score
</pre>
<p>It came out as this:</p>
<p>before-the-underscore<sub>aftertheunderscore</sub></p>
<p>But the curly-braces keeps them:</p>
<p>before-the-underscore<sub>after_the_under_score</sub></p>
<p>Which seems like an improvement anyway.</p>
<p>The only problem now is that I keep forgetting what to type in every time I want to use an underscore, which is why I'm making this post.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.litech.org/radvd/">radvd</a> (the router advertisement daemon) sends IPv6 advertisements and responds to node IPv6 requests. Here's the description from the man page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>radvd</b> is the router advertisement daemon for IPv6. It listens to router solicitations and sends router advertisements as described in "Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)" (RFC 4861). With these advertisements hosts can automatically configure their addresses and some other parameters. They also can choose a default router based on these advertisements.</p>

<p>Setting <b>radvd</b> is suspiciously easy compared to other linux services. First you install it.</p>
<pre class="example">

<p>Installing it will also start the service so we can use <code>systemctl</code> to check how it's doing.</p>

<p>You can see in the output that there's a line with <code>/etc/radvd.conf does not exist or is empty.</code>. To fix this we're going to create the configuration file.</p>

<h3 id="org0d63786">The Configuration File</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0d63786">
<p>Now create a configuration file (named <code>radvd.conf</code>). Here's an example.</p>
<pre class="example">
interface eth0

MaxRtrAdvInterval 4;
AdvSendAdvert on;
AdvManagedFlag on;

</pre>
<p>Note that the interface name depends on your system. Most linux systems don't use the <code>eth0</code> convention anymore. On my desktop the ethernet inteface is called <code>enp1s0</code> and on my raspberry pi it's <code>enxb827eb6c9129</code> so make sure you check what your interface name is using <code>ifconfig</code>.</p>
<p>Now move (or copy) the config file into <code>/etc/</code></p>
<pre class="example">
sudo mv radvd.conf /etc/
</pre>
<p>And then restart <code>radvd</code> and check its state.</p>

<p>So it looks like our daemon is working. If you restart the server, though, the IPv6 port forwarding won't be enabled so open up <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and un-comment out the following line.</p>
<pre class="example">
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
</pre>
<p>Now the next time you power on the computer it should be enabled.</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org922233a">
<p>To check if it's working you can put another device on the LAN and check <code>ifconfig</code>. In our <code>radvd.conf</code> file we defined the prefix for the address:</p>
<pre class="example">

</pre>
<p>So in the <code>ifconfig</code> output we should see an entry for an IPv6 address that starts with <code>2001:db7::</code>. In fact I ended up with two.</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7f966e7">
<p>I'm connecting to a remote network using <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> served by an ASUS access point. I originally did it at the command line.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn
</pre>
<p>It turns out that this doesn't allow me to access anything outside of the network that I was connecting to. From what I can tell it's a DNS problem, but nothing I found about fixing DNS problems with OpenVPN from the command line worked. Luckily the Network Settings GUI works, but even then, it didn't work out of the box.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orge9d36bf">
<h2 id="orge9d36bf">Initial Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge9d36bf">
<p>First, not everything you need is installed. Besides the openvpn client itself (which I had installed before trying to run it at the command line) you need some things for the network settings as well.</p>
<pre class="example">
apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome
</pre>
<p>Now open the network settings.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img alt=" network_settings_menu.png" src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/network_settings_menu.png"></p>
</div>
<p>In the window that pops up click on the + sign to add a connection.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img alt=" network_settings.png" src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/network_settings.png"></p>
</div>
<p>In the window that then pops up click on <code>Import from file...</code> (I'm assuming you are using a config file).</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img alt=" import_from_file.png" src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/import_from_file.png"></p>
</div>
<p>Navigate to the config file, and double-click on it. In the dialog that pops up enter whatever extra information you need. In my case it was the username and password.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img alt=" vpn_dialog.png" src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/vpn_dialog.png"></p>
</div>
<p>Click on the green 'Add' button and you should now have an entry for your VPN connection in the network settings. Click on the on switch (initially labeled 'Off') and if you're lucky it will connect.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img alt=" start_vpn.png" src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/start_vpn.png"></p>
</div>
<p>After you click on the switch it will look like this, but read on just in case it didn't.</p>

<h2 id="org693cbac">Fixing the Password Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org693cbac">
<p>Unfortunately for me it didn't connect. In <code>/var/log/syslog</code> I could see entries like this:</p>
<pre class="example">
gnome-shell[2805]: Invalid VPN service type (cannot find authentication binary)
</pre>
<p>I don't know if the message is directly telling you this (it doesn't seem to), but it turns out that for some reason the Network Settings doesn't save your password. Look in <code>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/</code> for a file that matches the name you gave your vpn in the settings. In my case it was just called 'client'. Open it as root in an editor.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo emacs /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/client
</pre>
<p>Then change this line in the <code>[vpn]</code> section:</p>
<pre class="example">
password-flags=1
</pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre class="example">
password-flags=0
</pre>
<p>Then add this section.</p>
<pre class="example">
[vpn-secrets]
password="your-password"
</pre>
<p>Where <code>"your-password"</code> is your vpn password. <i>The quotation marks around your password are required.</i></p>

<h2 id="org471ae08">Now Really Connect</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org471ae08">
<p>First restart the network manager.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo service network-manager restart
</pre>
<p>Now re-open the network settings and click on the switch again. With any luck this time it will stay on and you can check by going to one of the devices on your VPN network.</p>

<h2 id="org26d2b0d">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org26d2b0d">
<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a> to store packets and thought that it might be a good idea to put it on an external drive. It turned out to be a little more complicated than I thought it would be so here are my notes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org343b4cd">
<h2 id="org343b4cd">Setting Up The Drive</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org343b4cd">
<p>The first thing I wanted to do was format the drive. First I needed to get the name.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo lshw -C disk
</pre>
<p>Gave me this</p>
<pre class="example">
*-disk
      description: SCSI Disk
      product: Elements 25A1
      vendor: WD
      physical id: 0.0.0
      bus info: scsi@1:0.0.0
      logical name: /dev/sda
      version: 1014
      serial: WX71D186F83C
      size: 3725GiB (4TB)
      capabilities: gpt-1.00 partitioned partitioned:gpt
      configuration: ansiversion=6 guid=7ff8067e-6905-4746-a8ec-f3a1f90f99d0 logicalsectorsize=512 sectorsize=4096
</pre>
<p>So it's named <code>/dev/sda</code>. Now let's see if it's mounted.</p>
<pre class="example">
lsblk -f
</pre>
<pre class="example">
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL    UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
sda
└─sda1      ntfs   Elements A4F2DF7DF2DF5262
mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   PI_BOOT  EAD0-90DA                            /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   PI_ROOT  9d97a4df-a4eb-4b09-92b6-bb1ccfade0ee /
</pre>
<p>So you can see that there is a partition named <code>sda1</code> and it's formatted using <code>ntfs</code> and it isn't mounted. Since I'm running it with linux I'll reformant the drive using <code>ext4</code>. I'm also going to give it the label <code>westerndigital</code>.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo mkfs -t ext4 -L westerndigital /dev/sda1
</pre>
<pre class="example">
mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
/dev/sda1 contains a ntfs file system labelled 'Elements'
Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
</pre>
<p>Apparently Western Digital named the partition <code>Elements</code>. I entered <code>y</code> and continued.</p>
<pre class="example">
Creating filesystem with 976745728 4k blocks and 244187136 inodes

        102400000, 214990848, 512000000, 550731776, 644972544
</pre>
<p>So checking it again.</p>
<pre class="example">
lsblk -f
</pre>
<pre class="example">
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL          UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
sda
└─sda1      ext4   westerndigital cd10dc9f-7420-4b85-87ff-b8dfbf57f031
mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   PI_BOOT        EAD0-90DA                            /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   PI_ROOT        9d97a4df-a4eb-4b09-92b6-bb1ccfade0ee /

</pre>
<p>Shows that it's now <code>ext4</code> and it has the label <code>westerndigital</code>. According to <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingUUID">this page</a> the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) will auto-mount drives that have labels, although I haven't tested this yet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgf51846b">
<h2 id="orgf51846b">Mounting It</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf51846b">
<p>First make a directory for it.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo mkdir /media/westerndigital
</pre>
<p>Then mount it.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/westerndigital/
</pre>
<p>Now we can check on it.</p>
<pre class="example">
lsblk
</pre>
<pre class="example">
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0  3.7T  0 disk
└─sda1        8:1    0  3.7T  0 part /media/westerndigital
mmcblk0     179:0    0 29.8G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   63M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0 29.8G  0 part /
</pre>
<p>So we can see that it's mounted at <code>/media/westerndigital/</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgbac36b6">
<h2 id="orgbac36b6">Running TCP Dump with Rotating files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbac36b6">
<p>First I needed to put the wireless interface into monitor mode.</p>
<pre class="example">
iwconfig wlx00c0ca967afb mode monitor
</pre>
<p>Then I ran tcpdump.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo tcpdump -n -w /media/westerndigital//channel_6.pcap -C 1000 -W 10 --snapshot-length 0 --interface wlx00c0ca967afb -z gzip --relinquish-privileges erysichthon
</pre>
<p>Which gave me this.</p>
<pre class="example">
tcpdump: /media/westerndigital//channel_6.pcap0: Permission denied
</pre>
<p>On my desktop the solution was in the comments of this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18050659/tcpdump-w-1-pcap-works-but-tcpdump-c-100-w-1-pcap-permission-denied">StackOverflow post</a>.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.tcpdump
</pre>
<p>But on my raspberry pi this raised an error.</p>
<pre class="example">
Cache read/write disabled: interface file missing. (Kernel needs AppArmor 2.4 compatibility patch.)
Warning: unable to find a suitable fs in /proc/mounts, is it mounted?
Use --subdomainfs to override.
</pre>
<p>The solution was in the same post. I just made the permissions wide open.</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo chmod 777 /media/westerndigital
</pre>
<p>This is probably a security risk, but it works.</p>

<h2 id="orgbc2aaf5">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbc2aaf5">
<p>I recently started revisiting some <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a> code that I was working on at work and when I ran the unit-tests all of them failed with pretty much the same error.</p>
<pre class="example">
actual.should.equal is not a function. (In 'actual.should.equal(expected)', 'actual.should.equal' is an instance of ProxyObject)
</pre>
<p>I'm using the <a href="http://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should">chai BDD 'should'</a> style of testing, so this <i>should</i> have worked (because it was working before). To debug it I ran it with FireFox and when I did, all the tests mysteriously started working. It turns out I was using <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344">has been abandoned</a>, and somewhere along the line something in chai stopped working with it, so I decided to set up Firefox headless as my browser instead. This is how I did it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-org026607e">
<h2 id="org026607e">Set Up</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org026607e"></div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orge5e616d">
<h3 id="orge5e616d">Install the plugin</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge5e616d">
<p>I already had this installed for debugging, but I'll mention it anyway, for completeness.</p>
<pre class="example">
npm install karma-firefox-launcher --save-dev
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgbf0a4ce">
<h3 id="orgbf0a4ce">Set it up in Karma</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbf0a4ce">
<p>I'm running the tests using <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html">karma</a> and I had hoped that I would just have to change the name of the browser in the configuration, but it turns out to need a little setup in the <code>karma.conf.js</code> file. First get rid of the <code>PhantomJS</code> reference. Delete this:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span>browsers: ['PhantomJS'],
</pre></div>
<p>and replace it with this.</p>
<pre class="example">
browsers: ['FirefoxHeadless'],
</pre>
<p>The <code>FirefoxHeadless</code> browser isn't actually defined, so you have to add it (I put it right after the <code>browsers</code> declaration).</p>
<pre class="example">
customLaunchers: {
      'FirefoxHeadless': {
        base: 'Firefox',
        flags: [
          '-headless',
        ],
      }
    },
</pre>
<p>This tells karma to run <code>firefox</code> and pass in the <code>-headless</code> flag, as shown in the Mozilla documentation about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Headless_mode#Using_headless_mode">firefox's headless mode</a>. I found out how to do it from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46779498/running-karma-tests-in-headless-firefox-browser-not-working-on-jenkins">a question on Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p><code>PhantomJS</code> breaks the Chai's BDD style of testing, but since both Firefox and <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md">Chrome</a> have headless modes, using them instead makes it work without actually needing to have the GUI launch.</p>
