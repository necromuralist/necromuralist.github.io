   The id of this div is set in the =p5.js= =setup= function as the parent of the sketch.

#+begin_src html
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="walker.js"></script>
<div id="random-walk-container">
</div>
#+end_src

#+begin_export html
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="walker.js"></script>
<div id="random-walk-container">
</div>
#+end_export

#+INCLUDE: ../../files/posts/processing/a-random-walker/walker.js src javascript
