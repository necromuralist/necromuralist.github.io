<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7868bf3">
<p>
I came home the other day to find some things from my garage outside on the driveway. The garage door was closed but the bolt wasn't in place, so I guess I forgot to secure it and someone went in while I was at work. I have two Arlo security cameras, one pointing at my front lawn and one at my back (I just took the ones I had set up to catch intruders and pointed them outside so they aren't really set up correctly) and they are supposed to send me notifications when motion is detected, but I didn't recall seeing any, but then I looked at my phone and I had missed one earlier in the day, and when I looked at it there was a video showing someone standing outside my back door, but that was all, but I have a Continuous Video Recording (CVR) subscription so I decided to poke around, that's when I found out how horrible Arlo's CVR really is.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org287bb8c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org287bb8c">The Problem with Arlo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org287bb8c">
<p>
The first problem with the Arlo's CVR system is that it's not always reliable. I've had cameras randomly stop recording videos on the server and the only "fix" that the help desk was able to give me was to deauthorize and reauthorize them (and in some cases completely remove them from the base-station and re-add them). This seems to work, but whenever you deauthorize a camera the server dumps all your recordings, so if you think you want to save something you'll have to do that first or it won't be there when the camera gets re-authorized. But then if you try to save something you'll find that the Arlo doesn't provide a way to download the video. The work-around you'll find on the forums is to do a screen capture while it plays - a horrible system, especially since the flash interface is pretty flaky and doesn't always work on my PC. 
</p>

<p>
Then there's a secondary problem in that it's recording twenty-four hours a day - and they don't have a fast-forward button. They do have a timeline that you can click on to jump around, not only does this mean you might be jumping past events you want, but they don't really have a 'streaming' interface in the sense that Netflix or some other streaming service does where they're downloading small chunks so you don't have to wait a long time for the play to resume, instead the Arlo seems to be downloading one minute at a time so you have these really long waits, and the precision of the timeline isn't very good so you'll probably have to search a little bit just to find what you want.
</p>

<p>
There's also another problem, which is that the user-interface's timeline isn't accurate, so even if you know the time of an event, you can't use the time in the interface to find it. In my case the bit that was captured on my phone showing the trespasser gave me a time, and there was a little blue dot on the timeline showing that there was an event at that time, but there was nothing in the video. It turned out that the video for the camera I had out back was shifted fifty-five minutes into the future, which was even more confusing because the time for the camera I had in front wasn't shifted (that I know of) so when I looked at the video for the front around that time I <i>was</i> able to see the prowler arriving. 
</p>

<p>
But even once I found the places in the CVR that showed the prowler (I didn't have it pointing at my garage so I didn't see him actually doing anything other than probing (knocking and then trying to open the doors)) I still had the problem of how to get the video before Netgear decided to break again and I lost it all. This is where python came in.
</p>

<h2 id="org4ca42f8">The Python Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4ca42f8">
<p>
It turns out that even though netgear hasn't published an official API for the Arlo, some people (<a href="http://www.robertogallea.com/blog/netgear-arlo-api">like this guy</a>) have reverse-engineered the API and there are several python-based libraries on github that help you talk to the arlo. This <a href="https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo">one</a>, by <i>jeffreydwalter</i> was the one that I saw that helped with downloading the CVR videos so it's the one that I went with. It's on pypi, but the commit that added CVR support was made a month ago and I wasn't sure when the pypi code was uploaded so I decided to install it from the master branch, since I was going to use the example code to start my code anyway - by this I mean I had to pull the repository anyway, so I used the <code>setup.py</code> file to install it (in developer mode in case it changes).
</p>

<p>
The following code is basically what you can find in the example that comes with the repository called <a href="https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo/blob/master/examples/arlo-cvrdownload.py">arlo-cvrdownload.py</a> re-written to have a command-line interface and match my coding style more.

In order to use the API you need to have a Netgear account and you have to pass it to the server.

<code>dotenv</code> works by adding the values in the configuration file into the environment dictionary. Most of the convenience of it comes if you create a <code>.env</code> file at the base of your repository, in which case it will automatically find it for you, but even though I'm not doing that it still saves me from parsing the file myself, so I'll use it. Since the other properties (<code>username</code> and <code>password</code>) rely on the values already being in the dictionary I'm calling <code>load_dotenv</code> in the <code>config_path</code> setter so that it's there before they get used.

<h2 id="orgdc35da2">The Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdc35da2">
<p>
If you use underscores in org-mode it will treat them almost the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#Versions">latex</a> does, changing the text that immediately follows the underscore as a sub-string.
</p>

<p>
This:
</p>

<pre class="example">
before-the-underscore_aftertheunderscore
</pre>

<p>
Is rendered as this:
</p>

<p>
before-the-underscore<sub>aftertheunderscore</sub></p>

<p>
But sometimes you just want an underscore (especially if you are writing about python code).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8a9a369" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8a9a369">Stack Overflow to the Rescue (Again)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8a9a369">
<p>
I found the answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/698562/disabling-underscore-to-subscript-in-emacs-org-mode-export">on Stack Overflow</a> (of course) - you can add an <code>#+OPTIONS</code> directive to the file to disable this behavior. I originally went with the accepted answer which was to add <code>#+OPTIONS: ^:nil</code>, and it works in most cases, but then I couldn't figure out how to write this post, since the underscores stopped working and I didn't want to have to use MathJax to show what I meant (although maybe that wouldn't be so bad), so now I think the better answer is the one given by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/60183/danielpoe">danielpoe</a> in the comments - use <code>#+OPTIONS: ^:{}</code> instead. This disables the sub-scripting behavior of the underscore in most cases but allows you to add sub-scripting by putting the text following the underscore in curly-braces.
</p>

<p>
I wrote the example above, for instance, like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
before-the-underscore_{aftertheunderscore}
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org38c65d0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org38c65d0">A Final Note</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org38c65d0">
<p>
This solution doesn't replicate the original org-mode behavior completely when you use the curly-braces. Without the directive if you have multiple underscores org-mode puts everything after the first underscore in the sub-string and removes all subsequent underscores, smashing the words together.
</p>

<p>
When I wrote this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
before-the-underscore_after_the_under_score
</pre>

<p>
It came out as this:
</p>

<p>
before-the-underscore<sub>aftertheunderscore</sub></p>

<p>
But the curly-braces keeps them:
</p>

<p>
before-the-underscore<sub>after_the_under_score</sub></p>

<p>
Which seems like an improvement anyway. 
</p>

<p>
The only problem now is that I keep forgetting what to type in every time I want to use an underscore, which is why I'm making this post.

<p>
<a href="http://www.litech.org/radvd/">radvd</a> (the router advertisement daemon) sends IPv6 advertisements and responds to node IPv6 requests. Here's the description from the man page.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>radvd</b> is the router advertisement daemon for IPv6. It listens to router solicitations and sends router advertisements as described in "Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)" (RFC 4861). With these advertisements hosts can automatically configure their addresses and some other parameters. They also can choose a default router based on these advertisements.

<h2 id="org30c96be">Installation and Setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org30c96be">
<p>
Setting <b>radvd</b> is suspiciously easy compared to other linux services. First you install it.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo apt install radvd
</pre>

<p>
Installing it will also start the service so we can use <code>systemctl</code> to check how it's doing.
</p>

<pre class="example">
systemctl status radvd

</pre>

<p>
You can see in the output that there's a line with <code>/etc/radvd.conf does not exist or is empty.</code>. To fix this we're going to create the configuration file.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org86e4673" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org86e4673">The Configuration File</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org86e4673">
<p>
Now create a configuration file (named <code>radvd.conf</code>). Here's an example.
</p>

<pre class="example">
interface eth0
{
MinRtrAdvInterval 3;
MaxRtrAdvInterval 4;
AdvSendAdvert on;
AdvManagedFlag on;
prefix 2001:db7::/64
{ AdvValidLifetime 14300; AdvPreferredLifetime 14200; }
;
};
</pre>

<p>
Note that the interface name depends on your system. Most linux systems don't use the <code>eth0</code> convention anymore. On my desktop the ethernet inteface is called <code>enp1s0</code> and on my raspberry pi it's <code>enxb827eb6c9129</code> so make sure you check what your interface name is using <code>ifconfig</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now move (or copy) the config file into <code>/etc/</code>
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo mv radvd.conf /etc/
</pre>

<p>
And then restart <code>radvd</code> and check its state.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo service radvd restart
systemctl status radvd
</pre>

<p>
So it looks like our daemon is working. If you restart the server, though, the IPv6 port forwarding won't be enabled so open up <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and un-comment out the following line.
</p>

<pre class="example">
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
</pre>

<p>
Now the next time you power on the computer it should be enabled.

<h2 id="org37bf413">Checking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org37bf413">
<p>
To check if it's working you can put another device on the LAN and check <code>ifconfig</code>. In our <code>radvd.conf</code> file we defined the prefix for the address:
</p>

<pre class="example">
prefix 2001:db7::/64
</pre>

<p>
So in the <code>ifconfig</code> output  we should see an entry for an IPv6 address that starts with <code>2001:db7::</code>. In fact I ended up with two.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc512a18">
<p>
I'm connecting to a remote network using <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> served by an ASUS access point. I originally did it at the command line.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo openvpn --config client.ovpn
</pre>

<p>
It turns out that this doesn't allow me to access anything outside of the network that I was connecting to. From what I can tell it's a DNS problem, but nothing I found about fixing DNS problems with OpenVPN from the command line worked. Luckily the Network Settings GUI works, but even then, it didn't work out of the box.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2ebba23" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2ebba23">Initial Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2ebba23">
<p>
First, not everything you need is installed. Besides the openvpn client itself (which I had installed before trying to run it at the command line) you need some things for the network settings as well.
</p>

<pre class="example">
apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome
</pre>

<p>
Now open the network settings.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/network_settings_menu.png" alt=" network_settings_menu.png"></p>
</div>


<p>
In the window that pops up click on the + sign to add a connection.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/network_settings.png" alt=" network_settings.png"></p>
</div>

<p>
In the window that then pops up click on <code>Import from file...</code> (I'm assuming you are using a config file).
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/import_from_file.png" alt=" import_from_file.png"></p>
</div>

<p>
Navigate to the config file, and double-click on it. In the dialog that pops up enter whatever extra information you need. In my case it was the username and password.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/vpn_dialog.png" alt=" vpn_dialog.png"></p>
</div>

<p>
Click on the green 'Add' button and you should now have an entry for your VPN connection in the network settings. Click on the on switch (initially labeled 'Off') and if you're lucky it will connect.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="posts/openvpn-on-ubuntu-1804/start_vpn.png" alt=" start_vpn.png"></p>
</div>

<p>
After you click on the switch it will look like this, but read on just in case it didn't.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org28946ca">
<p>
Unfortunately for me it didn't connect. In <code>/var/log/syslog</code> I could see entries like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
gnome-shell[2805]: Invalid VPN service type (cannot find authentication binary)
</pre>

<p>
I don't know if the message is directly telling you this (it doesn't seem to), but it turns out that for some reason the Network Settings doesn't save your password. Look in <code>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/</code> for a file that matches the name you gave your vpn in the settings. In my case it was just called 'client'. Open it as root in an editor.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo emacs /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/client
</pre>

<p>
Then change this line in the <code>[vpn]</code> section:
</p>

<pre class="example">
password-flags=1
</pre>

<p>
to
</p>

<pre class="example">
password-flags=0
</pre>

<p>
Then add this section.
</p>

<pre class="example">
[vpn-secrets]
password="your-password"
</pre>

<p>
Where <code>"your-password"</code> is your vpn password. <i>The quotation marks around your password are required.</i>
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="orgea5d832">Now Really Connect</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgea5d832">
<p>
First restart the network manager.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo service network-manager restart
</pre>

<p>
Now re-open the network settings and click on the switch again. With any luck this time it will stay on and you can check by going to one of the devices on your VPN network.

<h2 id="orgf2160c2">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf2160c2">
<p>
I'm using <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a> to store packets and thought that it might be a good idea to put it on an external drive. It turned out to be a little more complicated than I thought it would be so here are my notes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga54eef5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga54eef5">Setting Up The Drive</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga54eef5">
<p>
The first thing I wanted to do was format the drive. First I needed to get the name.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo lshw -C disk
</pre>

<p>
Gave me this
</p>

<pre class="example">
*-disk
      description: SCSI Disk
      product: Elements 25A1
      vendor: WD
      physical id: 0.0.0
      bus info: scsi@1:0.0.0
      logical name: /dev/sda
      version: 1014
      serial: WX71D186F83C
      size: 3725GiB (4TB)
      capabilities: gpt-1.00 partitioned partitioned:gpt
      configuration: ansiversion=6 guid=7ff8067e-6905-4746-a8ec-f3a1f90f99d0 logicalsectorsize=512 sectorsize=4096
</pre>

<p>
So it's named <code>/dev/sda</code>. Now let's see if it's mounted.
</p>

<pre class="example">
lsblk -f
</pre>

<pre class="example">
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL    UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
sda
└─sda1      ntfs   Elements A4F2DF7DF2DF5262
mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   PI_BOOT  EAD0-90DA                            /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   PI_ROOT  9d97a4df-a4eb-4b09-92b6-bb1ccfade0ee /
</pre>

<p>
So you can see that there is a partition named <code>sda1</code> and it's formatted using <code>ntfs</code> and it isn't mounted. Since I'm running it with linux I'll reformant the drive using <code>ext4</code>. I'm also going to give it the label <code>westerndigital</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo mkfs -t ext4 -L westerndigital /dev/sda1
</pre>

<pre class="example">
mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
/dev/sda1 contains a ntfs file system labelled 'Elements'
Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
</pre>

<p>
Apparently Western Digital named the partition <code>Elements</code>. I entered <code>y</code> and continued.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Creating filesystem with 976745728 4k blocks and 244187136 inodes

        102400000, 214990848, 512000000, 550731776, 644972544
</pre>

<p>
So checking it again.
</p>

<pre class="example">
lsblk -f
</pre>

<pre class="example">
NAME        FSTYPE LABEL          UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT

mmcblk0
├─mmcblk0p1 vfat   PI_BOOT        EAD0-90DA                            /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 ext4   PI_ROOT        9d97a4df-a4eb-4b09-92b6-bb1ccfade0ee /

</pre>

<p>
Shows that it's now <code>ext4</code> and it has the label <code>westerndigital</code>. According to <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingUUID">this page</a> the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) will auto-mount drives that have labels, although I haven't tested this yet.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6cf59d7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6cf59d7">Mounting It</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6cf59d7">
<p>
First make a directory for it.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo mkdir /media/westerndigital
</pre>

<p>
Then mount it.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/westerndigital/
</pre>

<p>
Now we can check on it.
</p>

<pre class="example">
lsblk
</pre>

<pre class="example">
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0  3.7T  0 disk
└─sda1        8:1    0  3.7T  0 part /media/westerndigital
mmcblk0     179:0    0 29.8G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   63M  0 part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0 29.8G  0 part /
</pre>

<p>
So we can see that it's mounted at <code>/media/westerndigital/</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org58ac478" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org58ac478">Running TCP Dump with Rotating files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org58ac478">
<p>
First I needed to put the wireless interface into monitor mode.
</p>

<pre class="example">
iwconfig wlx00c0ca967afb mode monitor
</pre>

<p>
Then I ran tcpdump.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo tcpdump -n -w /media/westerndigital//channel_6.pcap -C 1000 -W 10 --snapshot-length 0 --interface wlx00c0ca967afb -z gzip --relinquish-privileges erysichthon
</pre>

<p>
Which gave me this.
</p>

<pre class="example">
tcpdump: /media/westerndigital//channel_6.pcap0: Permission denied
</pre>

<p>
On my desktop the solution was in the comments of this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18050659/tcpdump-w-1-pcap-works-but-tcpdump-c-100-w-1-pcap-permission-denied">StackOverflow post</a>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.tcpdump
</pre>

<p>
But on my raspberry pi this raised an error.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Cache read/write disabled: interface file missing. (Kernel needs AppArmor 2.4 compatibility patch.)
Warning: unable to find a suitable fs in /proc/mounts, is it mounted?
Use --subdomainfs to override.
</pre>

<p>
The solution was in the same post. I just made the permissions wide open.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo chmod 777 /media/westerndigital
</pre>

<p>
This is probably a security risk, but it works.

<p>
I recently started revisiting some <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a> code that I was working on at work and when I ran the unit-tests all of them failed with pretty much the same error.
</p>

<pre class="example">
actual.should.equal is not a function. (In 'actual.should.equal(expected)', 'actual.should.equal' is an instance of ProxyObject)
</pre>

<p>
I'm using the <a href="http://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should">chai BDD 'should'</a> style of testing, so this <i>should</i> have worked (because it was working before). To debug it I ran it with FireFox and when I did, all the tests mysteriously started working. It turns out I was using <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344">has been abandoned</a>, and somewhere along the line something in chai stopped working with it, so I decided to set up Firefox headless as my browser instead. This is how I did it.

I already had this installed for debugging, but I'll mention it anyway, for completeness.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1da3d2f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1da3d2f">Set it up in Karma</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1da3d2f">
<p>
I'm running the tests using <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html">karma</a> and I had hoped that I would just have to change the name of the browser in the configuration, but it turns out to need a little setup in the <code>karma.conf.js</code> file. First get rid of the <code>PhantomJS</code> reference. Delete this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>browsers: ['PhantomJS'],
</pre></div>

<p>
and replace it with this.
</p>

<pre class="example">
browsers: ['FirefoxHeadless'],
</pre>

<p>
The <code>FirefoxHeadless</code> browser isn't actually defined, so you have to add it (I put it right after the <code>browsers</code> declaration).
</p>

<pre class="example">
customLaunchers: {
      'FirefoxHeadless': {
        base: 'Firefox',
        flags: [
          '-headless',
        ],
      }
    },
</pre>

<p>
This tells karma to run <code>firefox</code> and pass in the <code>-headless</code> flag, as shown in the Mozilla documentation about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Headless_mode#Using_headless_mode">firefox's headless mode</a>. I found out how to do it from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46779498/running-karma-tests-in-headless-firefox-browser-not-working-on-jenkins">a question on Stack Overflow</a>.

<h2 id="org43f00f8">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org43f00f8">
<p>
I was looking for a way to update python dependencies that I'd installed with <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> when I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/">pip-tools</a>. I'm not particularly good about keeping everything in sync and up-to-date so I'm hoping that this will make it easier to do and thus more likely that I'll do it. It's been a little while since I first used it and I had to look it up, so these are my notes to my future self.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1afefb1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1afefb1">First pipdeptree</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1afefb1">
<p>
<code>pip-tools</code> installs a command named <code>pip-compile</code> which will use either the requirements you put in your <code>setup.py</code> file or a special file named <code>requirements.in</code> (if you call it this you don't have to pass in the filename, otherwise you have to tell it where to look). Unless there's only a few requirements I prefer to use a separate file, rather than <code>setup.py</code>, since it makes it clearer and more likely that I'll keep it up to date. The <code>requirements.in</code> file is a list of your dependencies but unlike the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, it doesn't have version numbers, the version numbers are added when you call the <code>pip-compile</code> command. 
</p>

<p>
So where does the <code>requirements.in</code> file come from? You have to make it. <i>But if you're editing things by hand, doesn't this kind of make it less likely you'll maintain it?</i> Yes, which is where <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree"><code>pipdeptree</code></a> comes in. <code>pipdeptree</code> will list all the python dependencies you installed as well as everything those dependencies pulled in as their dependencies. It's usefull to take a look at how a dependency you didn't directly install got into your virtual environment. You can install it from pypi.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install pipdeptree
</pre></div>

<p>
Here's its help output.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipdeptree -h
</pre></div>

<pre class="example">
usage: pipdeptree [-h] [-v] [-f] [-a] [-l] [-u] [-w [{silence,suppress,fail}]]
                  [-r] [-p PACKAGES] [-j] [--json-tree]
                  [--graph-output OUTPUT_FORMAT]

Dependency tree of the installed python packages

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -f, --freeze          Print names so as to write freeze files
  -a, --all             list all deps at top level
  -l, --local-only      If in a virtualenv that has global access do not show
                        globally installed packages
  -u, --user-only       Only show installations in the user site dir
  -w [{silence,suppress,fail}], --warn [{silence,suppress,fail}]
                        Warning control. "suppress" will show warnings but
                        return 0 whether or not they are present. "silence"
                        will not show warnings at all and always return 0.
                        "fail" will show warnings and return 1 if any are
                        present. The default is "suppress".
  -r, --reverse         Shows the dependency tree in the reverse fashion ie.
                        the sub-dependencies are listed with the list of
                        packages that need them under them.
  -p PACKAGES, --packages PACKAGES
                        Comma separated list of select packages to show in the
                        output. If set, --all will be ignored.
  -j, --json            Display dependency tree as json. This will yield "raw"
                        output that may be used by external tools. This option
                        overrides all other options.
  --json-tree           Display dependency tree as json which is nested the
                        same way as the plain text output printed by default.
                        This option overrides all other options (except
                        --json).
  --graph-output OUTPUT_FORMAT
                        Print a dependency graph in the specified output
                        format. Available are all formats supported by
                        GraphViz, e.g.: dot, jpeg, pdf, png, svg
</pre>

<p>
If you look at the options you can see that there's a <code>--freeze</code> option, that's what we'll be using. Let's look at some of what that looks like.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipdeptree --freeze <span class="p">|</span> head
</pre></div>


<p>
So it looks like the output of <code>pip freeze</code> except it puts the packages you installed flush-left and then uses indentation to indicate what that package installed. In the example above, I installed <a href="https://www.getnikola.com/handbook.html">Nikola</a>, then Nikola installed <a href="http://pydoit.org/">doit</a>, and doit installed <a href="https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle">cloudpickle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify">pyinotify</a>. I kind of remember needing to install <code>pyinotify</code> myself, but maybe <code>pydeptree</code> caught that it was a dependency that <code>doit</code> is using. Anyway.
</p>

<p>
For our <code>requirements.in</code> file we only want the names, and although there might be a reason to keep the entire tree, I think it makes it easier to understand what I'm using if the file only holds the dependencies at the top-level (the ones that I'm using directly, rather than being a dependency of a dependency). So, we'll use a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>. First, since I'm a python-programmer I'm going to give it the <code>-P</code> flag to use perl escape codes. Next, we want to only match the lines that have alpha-numeric characters as the first character in the line.
</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left"><code>+</code></td>
<td class="org-left">Match one or more</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
First, let's see how many total dependencies there are.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipdeptree --freeze <span class="p">|</span> wc -l
</pre></div>

<pre class="example">
: 160
</pre>

<p>
So there are 160 dependencies total. How many did I install?
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipdeptree --freeze <span class="p">|</span> grep --perl-regexp <span class="s2">"^\w+"</span> <span class="p">|</span> wc -l
</pre></div>

<p>
Out of the 160 only 11 were directly installed by me.
</p>

<p>
<i>So we're done, right?</i> Not yet, we need to get rid of the <code>==</code> and version numbers. I hadn't known that grep had this feature, since I normally use python instead of grep, but grep has an <code>--only-matching</code> option that will discard the parts of the line that don't match. 
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left"><code>grep</code></th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Description</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td class="org-left">
<code>-o</code>, <code>--only-matching</code>
</td>
<td class="org-left">Only show the parts of the line that match</td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipdeptree --freeze <span class="p">|</span> grep --only-matching --perl-regexp <span class="s2">"^\w+"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
If you look at the first entry you'll notice it says <code>ghp</code>, but the actual name of the package is <code>ghp-import</code>, but the hyphen isn't part of the alpha-numeric set, so we'll have to add it.
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">grep</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Description</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td class="org-left"><code>[]</code></td>
<td class="org-left">Match one or the entries in the brackets</td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipdeptree --freeze <span class="p">|</span> grep -oP <span class="s2">"^[\w\-]+"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This looks like what we want, but there's a couple of things that we should take care of that would happen if this were for an installed package.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there's <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-pip/+bug/1635463">a bug in ubuntu</a> that causes pip to include <code>pkg-resources</code>, which isn't something you can install.</li>
<li>it will add an extra entry for your python egg, something like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
-e git+git@github.com:russell-n/iperflexer.git@65f4d3ca72670591f584efa6fa9bfd64c18a925b#egg=iperflexer
</pre>

<p>
So we should filter those out.
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left"><code>grep</code></th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Description</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td class="org-left">
<code>-v</code>, <code>--invert-match</code>
</td>
<td class="org-left">Return lines that don't match</td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipdeptree --freeze <span class="p">|</span> grep --only-matching --perl-regexp <span class="s2">"^[\w\-]+"</span> <span class="p">|</span> grep --invert-match <span class="s2">"\-e\|pkg"</span>
</pre></div>

<pre class="example">
ghp-import2
graphviz
Nikola
notebook
pip-tools
pipdeptree
virtualfish
watchdog
webassets
wheel
ws4py
</pre>

<p>
There are probaby other exceptions that have to be added for other installations, but this looks like enough for us. Now we can redirect this to a <code>requirements.in</code> file and we're ready for <code>pip-tools</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
pipdeptree --freeze | grep --only-matching --perl-regexp "^[\w\-]+" | grep --invert-match "\-e\|pkg" &gt; requirements.in
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6166d78" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6166d78">pip-compile</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6166d78">
<p>
<code>pip-compile</code> will read in the <code>requirements.in</code> file and add the version numbers and can create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file. It will automatically look for the <code>requirements.in</code> file or you can explicitly pass in the filename.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip-compile <span class="p">|</span> head
</pre></div>

<pre class="example">
#

If we stopped at this point we'd have:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a way to check who installed what using <code>pipdeptree</code> (as well as a way to plot the dependencies as a graph)</li>
<li>a way to separate out our dependencies into a separate file (<code>requirements.in</code>) to make it easier to read</li>
<li>a way to create our <code>requirements.txt</code> file using our <code>requirements.in</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think that's kind of nice already, especially if you end up with a lot of dependencies. Try working with <a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">sphinx</a> and <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> and you'll see things start to explode. But of course, there's always more.

<div id="outline-container-orgb08a04f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb08a04f">Upgrade</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb08a04f">
<p>
You can run  <code>pip-compile</code> with the <code>--upgrade</code> option to try and update dependencies whenever you want to make sure you have the latest of everything (you can do it per-package too, but nah).
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip-compile --upgrade <span class="p">|</span> head

<p>
This will upgrade your installation but not update the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, so you can test it out and see if everything works before updating the <code>requirements.txt</code>. If things don't work out, you could reinstall from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, but see the next section for another way.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org50cac0c">
<p>
<code>pip-tools</code> also installed a command called <code>pip-sync</code> which will keep you in sync with what is in the requirements file, so as long as <code>requirements.txt</code> is always a working version, you can sync up with it to avoid problems with changes in any of the dependencies. This is different from the <code>--upgrade</code> option in that it will only install the exact version in the requirements file.

I'm trying to set-up a wireless packet monitor (it's something I've long thought might be an interesting source of data, and now I need it for work too). My thought was that I'd set up a raspberry pi to experiment with - I don't think it is powerful enough to work, but it should work just to mess with code, and a distributed system might get some interesting results, but anyway - but when I tried to put my raspberry pi's wireless interface into monitor mode I got an error.
</p>

<pre class="example">
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06) :
    SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported.

<p>
Looking around on the web I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/4ah4oi/psa_the_raspberry_pi_3s_embedded_wifi_card_does/">this reddit post</a> as well as some Stack Overflow posts that said that monitor mode isn't supported on the Raspberry Pi. There is a project called <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon">nexmon</a> that apparently lets up add a firmware patch to enable it, which I'll probably try later, but before I tried that I remembered that I have a Realtek 8812AU USB WiFi adapter that I bought a while ago for an old desktop I had that I wasn't using so I decided to try it.

The first thing I did was to see if it would just work. I plugged the Realtek into the USB port and although <code>lsusb</code> showed it, <code>iwconfig</code> didn't show it as an interface. Back to the internet.

Next I found <a href="https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU">a repository on github</a> that has the driver for the Realtek set up for linux machines. I downloaded it and followed the instructions to build it - the main thing is to set:
</p>

<pre class="example">
CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = n
CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = y
</pre>

<p>
in the <code>Makefile</code> - but when I tried to build it I got this error.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo dkms install -m $DRV_NAME -v $DRV_VERSION

'make' KVER=4.4.38-v7+....(bad exit status: 2)
ERROR (dkms apport): binary package for rtl8812AU: 4.3.20 not found
Error! Bad return status for module build on kernel: 4.4.38-v7+ (armv7l)
Consult /var/lib/dkms/rtl8812AU/4.3.20/build/make.log for more information.
</pre>

<p>
There was also a message in the <code>make.log</code> file but I didn't remember to copy it.

<h2 id="orgfba0b96">What fixed it</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfba0b96">
<p>
The solution was in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39775844/how-to-make-dkms-pass-the-right-arch-to-make">this StackOverflow post</a> - the <code>make</code> program is being pointed to a folder named <code>arm7l</code> (thats 'arm seven ell') but it should actually be pointed to one named <code>arm</code>. The simple solution is to create an alias with the correct name.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-4.4.38-v7+/arch/arm/ /usr/src/linux-headers-4.4.38-v7+/arch/armv7l
</pre>

<p>
This turns out to fix the build problem and after a reboot the network interface showed up.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org243bbcf">
<p>
The Raspberry Pi 3 doesn't support monitor mode for its wireless interface out of the box, and while there is a firmware patch to enable it, I chose to use a Realtek RTL 8812AU USB WiFi adapter instead. You need a little bit of extra work to get it going, but it does seem to work. One thing I noticed is that <code>iwconfig</code> will put it in monitor mode but <code>airmon-ng</code> doesn't (I haven't figured out why yet). It doesn't report an error, it just doesn't seem to work. Also, <code>iw</code> always reports the interface as managed, even when it isn't… maybe I'll try the firmware patch after all.
