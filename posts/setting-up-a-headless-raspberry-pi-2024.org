Clicking "download for ubuntu x86" downloaded a debian file (~imager_latest_amd64.deb~) to my ~downloads~ folder which i used to install the imager.

#+begin_src fish
cd ~/downloads/
sudo dpkg -i imager_latest_amd64.deb
#+end_src

[[https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=305629#p1828629f][This post]] (/re: confused about hardware and os being 32 or 64bit/) on the raspberry pi forums gives a reasonable sounding reason for using the 32-bit image.



#+begin_quote
The Pi3 series use 64-bit ARM cores with a 32-bit GPU. The recommended RPiOS is 32-bit with the option of using the 64-bit kernel (userland is still 32 bit).
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
You can also use the full 64-bit beta OS, but there's not much advantage on a 3B with only 1GB of RAM (64-bit OS and software will use more RAM than 32-bit). Unless you have a specific need for a 64 bit OS, use the 32 bit version on the Pi3B (64-bit OS makes more sense on the Pi4 models with more RAM).
#+end_quote

According to [[https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-imager?tab=readme-ov-file#telemetry][the imager's github README]] the Telemetry option is being used to count information about what OS the imager is run on and what OS you're adding to the image (I think, it doesn't reference the gui).

#+begin_quote
In order to understand usage of the application (e.g. uptake of Raspberry Pi Imager versions and which images and operating systems are most popular) when using the default image repository, the URL, operating system name and category (if present) of a selected image are sent along with the running version of Raspberry Pi Imager, your operating system, CPU architecture, locale and Raspberry Pi revision (if applicable) to https://rpi-imager-stats.raspberrypi.com by downloadstatstelemetry.cpp.

/This web service is hosted by Heroku and only stores an incrementing counter using a Redis Sorted Set for each URL, operating system name and category per day in the eu-west-1 region and does not associate any personal data with those counts/  [emphasis added]. This allows us to query the number of downloads over time and nothing else.
