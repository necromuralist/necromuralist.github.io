* What Is This About?
  This is how to mount a LUKS encrypted drive with [[https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/cryptsetup.8.html][cryptsetup]] in Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla). My use-case is I have a headless server that has an external USB drive that's encrypted with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup][LUKS]] that I need to mount from the command line. I like the flexibility it gives a little more than the what the Gnome GUI does so I'll probably use it on my desktop as well. I previously documented how to do it with [[http://storaged.org/doc/udisks2-api/latest/udisksctl.1.html][udiskctl]] in {{% lancelot title="this post" %}}mounting-an-encrypted-usb-drive{{% /lancelot %}} but I like =cryptsetup= a little better. This assumes that you know the partition/device (in my case it's =/dev/sdb1=). That previous post shows how I found it so I'll just do the decrypting and mounting here.
* So, How Do You Do It?
  The syntax to decrypt the device is:

#+begin_example
sudo cryptsetup open <device> <name>
#+end_example

As I mentioned above, in this case my =device= is =/dev/sdb1=. The name can be an arbitrary one (although there are limitiations on special characters so let's say it can be any alpha-numeric name) and I'll use =wddata= as the name. Then my command to decrypt the drive is:

#+begin_example
sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdb1 wddata
#+end_example

This will prompt you for your password and then the encryption passphrase. Once the command succeeds, it adds a link in =/dev/mapper= using the name you passed in so you can mount the device (assuming the directory you want to mount it in exists) like this:

#+begin_example
sudo mount /dev/mapper/wddata /media/data
#+end_example

Where =wddata= is the name I told =cryptsetup= to use and =/media/data= is a directory that I had previously created.

* Source
  Besides the man-page for =cryptsetup= on my server, I was pointed to use =cryptsetup= from this StackOverflow post:
  - https://askubuntu.com/questions/63594/mount-encrypted-volumes-from-command-line

The accepted answer uses =udiskctl= but further down is an answer by George Sch√∂lly using =cryptsetup=. The syntax in the answer is the older =cryptsetup= syntax (which should still work) so it doesn't look exactly like what I used.
