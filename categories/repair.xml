&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; I had it hang again on rebooting so there's an update at the end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="orgf8739f6"&gt;What is this about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf8739f6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I updated from Ubuntu 18.04 to &lt;a href="https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/10/19/welcome-ubuntu-desktop-18-10"&gt;Ubuntu 18.10&lt;/a&gt; (Cosmic Cuttlefish) last night and upon rebooting found that I couldn't (finish rebooting, that is). In order to write this I had to recover from the problem so I don't have a screen-grab of the error, but it was basically the same one given in &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/837143/failed-to-connect-to-lvmetad"&gt;this Stack Overflow post&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you read the Stack Overflow post I linked to above, the solution was to downgrade the kernel version using the grub loader so, following that advice, I brought up the Grub menu by holding down the shift key while the machine booted up, then tried to move the cursor down to &lt;i&gt;Advanced&lt;/i&gt; in the menu using the arrow keys but for some reason it wouldn't move. I thought maybe it was my &lt;a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/"&gt;Ultimate Hacking Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; so I went and grabbed my &lt;a href="http://vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&amp;amp;kind2=225&amp;amp;kind3=&amp;amp;kind4=1043"&gt;Vortex&lt;/a&gt; keyboard instead and it still wouldn't work, and at this point some people might think that it probably was not the keyboard, but nope, I went and grabbed my &lt;a href="http://redragonusa.com/products/keyboard/K552/47"&gt;Redragon&lt;/a&gt; keyboard and all of a sudden it worked. Why did my $30 keyboard work better than my $300 keyboard? And no, I don't think I paid that much when I bought the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (but it took something like two years to ship so I probably spent more than that in lost time). Well, anyway, it turned out that I plugged the last keyboard in the left USB slot while my other keyboards were in the right USB slot and for some reason the right slot was disabled when I went into the Grub Menu. No mention of that on Stack Overflow, unfortunately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org5f38d2d" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org5f38d2d"&gt;What did work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5f38d2d"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I was googling around I found &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/969917/failed-to-connect-to-lvmetad-stuck-on-boot"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow where it was mentioned that the solution did mess with the kernel but it also mentions that he purged his nvidia drivers, which struck a chord with me because I've had problems with the nvidia drivers on my computer at work whenever I upgrade so I thought that maybe this might be something to check out first, before messing with the kernel. The post suggested using &lt;code&gt;ctrl-alt-f3&lt;/code&gt; to get into a terminal which didn't work for me for some reason so I used the Grub Menu instead. Here's the steps for my future self.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the shift key down while the machine boots up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Grub Menu use the arrow keys and return to choose the &lt;i&gt;Advanced&lt;/i&gt; option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the &lt;code&gt;(recovery mode)&lt;/code&gt; version of the current kernel (4.18.0)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Recovery Menu choose the &lt;code&gt;root Drop to root shell prompt&lt;/code&gt; option (you have to hit enter again at the next prompt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file-system for Recovery Mode is in read-only mode so mount the drive with =mount –options remount,rw /" (you can do this from the Recovery Menu as well, but it's an extra step either way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purge the drivers with &lt;code&gt;apt purge nvidia-*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; then back out of Recovery Mode and finish the startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I got the stuff about removing the nvidia driver from &lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/899309/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-disable-nvidia-driver-from-grub"&gt;this Stack Overflow post&lt;/a&gt;. It took a longer time than I thought it would to start up, but I'm writing this from my machine so it seems to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgdd55d21" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgdd55d21"&gt;Anything Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdd55d21"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ubuntu-drivers devices
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd00001402sv00001043sd00008581bc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GM206 [GeForce GTX 950]
driver   : nvidia-driver-390 - distro non-free recommended
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin


&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This card actually tended to freeze when I used the open source video drivers that come with Ubuntu so not having the Nvidia drivers seemed like a bad idea. I'm hoping that re-installing them will fix whatever bad setup values were there so I did:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cross your fingers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb970c73" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb970c73"&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb970c73"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, I didn't mention it above (because I hadn't noticed) but the bluetooth interface wouldn't start. The GUI actually let me click on the on-switch but nothing changed and when I looked in Journalctl I could see that it was raising errors. Even &lt;i&gt;hciconfig&lt;/i&gt; couldn't bring it up. Maddeningly, there are posts out there that showed the same errors that I saw (like &lt;a href="https://www.queryxchange.com/q/3_772706/bluetooth-problem-after-upgrade-from-ubuntu-14-to-16-04/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) but not only did none of the fixes they suggested work, but once I rebooted the problem went away, so I could have tried that before troubleshooting, and avoided all the hassle (maybe). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, every solution creates a problem, and while rebooting fixed my bluetooth interface it also revealed that I had the same problems as before (only my Redragon keyboard really works on the Grub menu and the boot hangs after the initial login to decrypt the disk). I removed the nvidia drivers again and this time I didn't reinstall them before rebooting and now it works, but now I don't know if my GUI is going to start hanging again like it used to. Oh, well, one problem at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
