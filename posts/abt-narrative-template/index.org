Randy Olson in his book {{% doc %}}narrative-is-everything{{% /doc %}} offers up a form that he asserts is the best way to structure communications - =__ And __ But __, Therefore __.= The idea is that you should start by creating a context so the reader knows what's going on, then follow it with a statement that introduces a problem (the "but") and finally finishes with a resolution. Although he calls it *ABT* some of his alternative three-word forms are a little easier to understand.

| Hero's Journey     | Template      | Comedy    | Science    | Argument | Business   |
|--------------------+---------------+-----------+------------+----------+------------|
| The ordinary world | Agreement     | Setup     | Hypothesis | They Say | Situation  |
| The other world    | Contradiction | Twist     | Experiment | I Say    | Conflict   |
| The return         | Consequence   | Punchline | Discussion | We Say   | Resolution |


Although I think there's one more form that he talks about but I didn't see it given a specific use-case.

 - Context    
 - Conflict  
 - Consequence
