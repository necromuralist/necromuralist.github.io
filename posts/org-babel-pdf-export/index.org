#+END_COMMENT

These are my notes on exporting a PDF from an /org-babel/ file.

* First Try

The key sequence to export a PDF from an /org/ file is =C-c C-e l p= (/e/ as in /export/, /l/ as in /LaTex/, and /p/ as in /PDF/). My first try produced this error:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
! LaTeX Error: File `ulem.sty` not found.
#+END_SRC

Past experience told me that I was likely missing a (debian) package.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports both
apt-cache search ulem
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: texlive-generic-recommended - TeX Live: Generic recommended packages
: libextutils-modulemaker-perl - Perl extension to build module from scratch

Since I'm doing something with /LaTex/, not /perl/ I decided that installing the /texlive-generic-recommended/ package was probably what I should do.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /sudo:: :results none
sudo apt-fast install texlive-generic-recommended
#+END_SRC

* Second try
I hit =C-c C-e l p= again and this time it did output a PDF, but there was no syntax-highlighting of the code. Followng [[https://joat-programmer.blogspot.com/2013/07/org-mode-version-8-and-pdf-export-with.html][this blog post]] I added this to my =init.el= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; export to latex/pdf
  (require 'ox-latex)

  ;; syntax-highlighting for pdf's
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "minted"))
  (setq org-latex-listings 'minted)
  (setq org-latex-pdf-process '("pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+END_SRC

Once I re-loaded the =init.el= file, the PDF's came out with the syntax highlighting working.

#+ATTR_RST: :directive note
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The original post used =xelatex= instead of =pdflatex= but I don't use =xelatex=. Also =minted= can be found in the =texlive-latex-extras= package if it isn't already installed. The post also mentions needing =pygments= but I didn't need it, possibly because it's a dependency for other python libraries that I've already installed.
