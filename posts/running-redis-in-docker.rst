These are the quick notes.

.. note:: Redis uses port 6379 as the default, which is where those ports in the command come from.   

Install
-------

.. code:: bash

   docker pull redis
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis redis

Use it with python-redis
------------------------

.. code:: python

   import redis
   client = redis.Redis("localhost", 6379)
   client.keys()

The ``client.keys()`` is a double-check. The ``client`` object won't actually try to connect to the server until you call it.
