I have a &lt;a href="http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail/1/hl2140/Overview"&gt;Brother HL-2140 Laser Printer&lt;/a&gt; which was working previously but for some reason gave me a CUPs error when I tried to print today (I think this was the first time I'd tried to print since upgrading to Ubuntu 14.10). I searched for the error on the web and found this &lt;a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1748457"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; that didn't address my problem directly but did address a problem I had when I set up my printer before (on Ubuntu 14.04 - I'm using 14.10 now) where the printer would churn out blank pages instead of printing what I wanted so I decided to give it a try again. There are a few suggestions on the page but the two I tried both suggested using a different driver.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first suggestion I tried was to use the &lt;i&gt;HL-2170&lt;/i&gt; instead of the/HL-2140./ This worked when I printed the first test page but after that it just silently failed no matter what I tried to install.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next suggestion I tried was to use the &lt;i&gt;Brother HL-2140 Foomatic/hpijs-pcl5e&lt;/i&gt; driver. This didn't print any pages for me and gave a &lt;code&gt;Idle - filter failed&lt;/code&gt; error in the printer properties dialogue
box. I don't know what the message means, but since I fixed it without knowing, I guess I don't need to know.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sandwiched between the &lt;i&gt;HL-2170&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;HL-2140&lt;/i&gt; models in the list of available drivers was the &lt;i&gt;HL-2142&lt;/i&gt; model. Since it seemed close enough to the 2140 (only off by two) I decided to try it and for whatever reason it worked. I'm pretty sure I used one of drivers the forum post suggested when I was using 14.04 (and the default &lt;i&gt;HL-2140&lt;/i&gt; driver before that) but something seems to have changed again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There's two lessons here:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  1. Use the &lt;i&gt;HL-2142&lt;/i&gt; driver for the &lt;i&gt;Brother HL-2140&lt;/i&gt; printer on Ubuntu 14.10
  2. Try drivers for similar models if you upgrade your Ubuntu installation and the printer stops working
