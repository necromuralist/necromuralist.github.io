* What is this about?
This is an initial look at how to use org-babel to create a literate-programming document. In the past I have used jupyter notebooks and pweave to do similar things, with each having a separate role - jupyter notebooks are good for interactive exploration but somewhat less amenable to working with sphinx (which I did with pweave). The hope here is that the org-babel system will provide something more amenable to both. Since you still have to convert the org-files to restructured text files (with pandoc or ox-nikola) it's still not everything I wanted, but hopefully this will make things a little easier

Most of this is stolen from [[http://home.fnal.gov/~neilsen/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html][this page]] - I'm fairly new to org-babel in general so I'm just walking in other people's footsteps for now.

Also, the inclusion of the org-babel code turned out to be both tedious and aesthetically unsatisfying so I didn't do it as much as I thought I would. The original org-file is [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/necromuralist/necromuralist.github.io/master/posts/python-with-org-babel/index.org][here]].
* High-Level Module Structure
One nice thing about the org-babel/noweb system is that it has a system that makes it easy to create a template (in this case based on the the module structure from [[http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#module-structure][Code Like A Pythonista]]) with parts that we're updating inserted using the noweb syntax. To actually see this I had to include the python code as an org-mode snippet so the syntax highlighting isn't there. 

  #+begin_src org
  #+begin_src python :noweb yes :tangle literate_python/literate.py
    """A docstring for the literate.py module"""

    # imports
    import sys
    <<literate-main-imports>>

    # constants

    # exception classes

    # interface funchtions

    # classes


    <<LiterateClass-definition>>

    # internal functions & classes

    <<literate-main>>


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        status = main()
        sys.exit(status)
  ,#+end_src
  #+end_src

This is what the final file looks like once the no-web substitutions happen.

  #+begin_src python :noweb yes :tangle literate_python/literate.py
    """A docstring for the literate.py module"""

    # imports
    import sys
    <<literate-main-imports>>

    # constants

    # exception classes

    # interface funchtions

    # classes


    <<LiterateClass-definition>>

    # internal functions & classes

    <<literate-main>>


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        status = main()
        sys.exit(status)
  #+end_src

To create the `literate.py` file (and all the other code-files) you see above execute ~M-x org-babel-tangle~.

* LiterateClass
This is the class definition that get substituted above. The code block for the definition is named =LiterateClass-definition= so the main template will substitute its contents for ~<<LiterateClass-definition>>~ when it gets tangled.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file literate_python/literateclass.png :exports results
skinparam monochrome true

LiterateClass : String who
LiterateClass : String ()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[img-url:literate_python/literateclass.png]]


#+NAME: LiterateClass-definition
#+begin_src python
  class LiterateClass(object):
      """A class to be substituted above

      Parameters
      ----------

      String who: name of user
      """
      def __init__(self, who):
          self.who = who
          return

      def __call__(self):
          print("Who: {0}".format(self.who))
#+end_src

* Main functions
The *Code Like a Pythonista* template expects that you are creating a command-line executable with a *main* entry-point. This section implements that case as an example.

First the =<<literate-main-imports>>=.

#+name: literate-main-imports
#+begin_src python
  from argparse import ArgumentParser
#+end_src

Now the =<<literate-main>>=.

#+name: literate-main
#+begin_src python
    def main():
        parser = ArgumentParser(description="literate caller")
        parser.add_argument("-w", "--who", type=str,
                            default="me", help="who are you?")
        args = parser.parse_args()
        who = args.who
        thing = LiterateClass(who)
        thing()
        return 0
#+end_src

As a quick check we can run the code at the command line to see that it's working (the main block has to be tangled for this to work).
#+name: bashrun-main
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
python literate_python/literate.py --who "Not Me"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: bashrun-main
: Who: Not Me

* Testing
  One nice thing about the org-babel infrastructure is that the tests and source can be put in the same org-file, then exported to separate files to be run.
** Doctest
   For the stdout output, doctesting can be a convenient way to check that things are behaving as expected while also providing an explicit example of how to run the command-line interface.
*** Setting up the cases
    The output of a successful doctest is nothing, which is good for automated tests but less interesting here so I'll make a doctest that passes and one that should fail.

    This next section (named =literate-doctest=) creates a code snippet that will pass. 

#+name: literate-doctest
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  example::
    >>> from literate_python.literate import LiterateClass
    >>> thing = LiterateClass("Gorgeous George")
    >>> thing()
    Who: Gorgeous George
#+END_SRC

And now here's a test (named =literate-bad-doctest=) that will fail.

#+name: literate-bad-doctest
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  bad::
    >>> bad_thing = LiterateClass("Gorilla Glue")
    >>> bad_thing()
    Who: Magilla Gorilla
#+END_SRC

This next section will include the two doctests and export them to a file so they can be tested. Note that you need an empty line between the tests for both of them to run. Warning - since this file is going to be exported, if you are using ~nikola~ or some other system that assumes all files with a certain file-extension are blog-posts you have to use an extension that won't get picked up (in my case both ~rst~ and ~txt~ were interpreted as blog-posts).

#+begin_src org
#+begin_src text :noweb yes :tangle literate_python/test_literate_output.doctest :exports none
<<literate-doctest>>

<<literate-bad-doctest>>
,#+end_src
#+end_src

Which gets tangled into this. Note that the doctests aren't valid python so you can tangle this but not execute it.

#+begin_src python :noweb yes :tangle literate_python/test_literate_output.doctest
  <<literate-doctest>>

  <<literate-bad-doctest>>
#+end_src

*** Running the doctests
    Now we can actually run them with python to see what happens.
#+name: run-doctest
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
python -m doctest literate_python/test_literate_output.doctest
true
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: run-doctest
#+begin_example
**********************************************************************
File "literate_python/test_literate_output.doctest", line 9, in test_literate_output.doctest
Failed example:
    bad_thing()
Expected:
    Who: Magilla Gorilla
Got:
    Who: Gorilla Glue
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   5 in test_literate_output.doctest
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
#+end_example

Note that since this returned a non-zero exit code (I think) you need to put =true= in the code block or there would be no output.

** PyTest BDD
   While doctests are neat I prefer unit-testing, in particular using Behavior Driven Development (BDD) facilitated in this case by ~py.test~ and ~pytest_bdd~.

*** The feature file
    Identifying the code-block with ~#+begin_src feature~ adds some syntax highlighting (if you have feature-mode installed and set-up). This works both when you are in the external editor and in the main org-babel document as well.

To make sure that org-babel recognizes feature mode add this to the ~init.el~ file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("feature" . "feature"))
#+end_src

This is what is going in the feature file.

#+name: literate-feature
#+begin_src feature
  Feature: Literate Class
  Scenario: Creating a literate object
    Given a name
    When a Literate object is created with the name
    Then the literate object has the name
#+end_src

#+begin_src feature-mode :noweb yes :tangle literate_python/literate.feature :exports none
<<literate-feature>>
#+end_src

*** The test file

    This is another file that gets tangled out. In this case it is so that we can run ~py.test~ on it.
#+begin_src python :noweb yes :tangle literate_python/testliterate.py
  from expects import expect
  from expects import equal
  from pytest import fixture
  from pytest_bdd import given
  from pytest_bdd import scenario
  from pytest_bdd import then
  from pytest_bdd import when

  # this code
  from literate import LiterateClass

  FEATURE_FILE = "literate.feature"


  class Context(object):
      """context object"""


  @fixture
  def context():
      return Context()


  @scenario(FEATURE_FILE, "Creating a literate object")
  def test_constructor():
      return


  @given("a name")
  def add_name(context, faker):
      context.name = faker.name()


  @when('a Literate object is created with the name')
  def create_object(context):
      context.object = LiterateClass(context.name)


  @then("the literate object has the name")
  def check_object_name(context):
      expect(context.name).to(equal(context.object.who))
      return
#+end_src

*** Running the test
    One important thing to note is that this will put an error message in a separate buffer if something goes wrong (like you don't have py.test installed), which in at least some cases makes it look like it failed silently. Unlike with the doctests, no output means something in the setup needs to be fixed, so you should tangle the file and then run it at the command-line to debug what happened.
#+name: shell-run-pytest
#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
py.test -v literate_python/testliterate.py
#+end_src

* Getting This Into Nikola
I tried three ways to get this document into nikola:
  - converting to rst with pandoc
  - exporting it with [[https://github.com/masayuko/ox-nikola][ox-nikola]]
  - using the [[https://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode][orgmode]] plugin for nikola

*ox-nikola* worked (as did pandoc), but at the moment I'm trying to use the *orgmode* plugin so that I can keep editing this document without having to convert back and forth. This is turning out to be about the same amount of work as using jupyter (and with a steeper learning curve). But I like the folding and navigation that org-mode offers, so I'll stick with it for a bit. I'm just using the default set-up right now. It seems to work. 

The main problem I had initially was the same one I had with jupyter - I'm starting with a file that wasn't generated by the ~nikola new_post~ sub-command so it didn't have the header that *nikola* expected but the only error ~nikola build~ reported was an invalid date format. 

This is what needs to be at the top of the org-file for nikola to work with it (or something like it).

The other thing is that the org-mode plugin doesn't seem to copy over the png-files correctly (or at all) so I had to create a ~files/posts/python-with-org-babel/literate_python~ folder and move the UML diagram over there by hand. Lastly, it didn't color the feature file and since there's no intermediate rst-file I don't really know how to fix this. Either I'm going to have to learn a lot more about org-mode than I might want to, or for cases where I want more control over things I'll use *ox-nikola* to convert it to rst first and edit it. That kind of wrecks the one-document idea, but I guess it would also give me a reason to re-work and polish things instead of improvising everything.
