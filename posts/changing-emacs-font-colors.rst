.. description: How to change font-colors in Emacs.
.. type: text

I prefer a white background with dark text when I work, which generally works well-enough but some modes in Emacs create foreground-background colors that make it hard to impossible to read. The simplest way to change a font's colors is with the ``customize-face`` command.
   
Example: Changing This Headline
-------------------------------

The original color for this headline in ``rst-mode`` was magenta (not by default, I had changed things a couple of times).

To change it I moved my cursor onto the headline and entered ``M-x customize-face``.

.. image:: enter_customize_face.png
           
This brings up a prompt so you can enter the particular `face` you want to change. I didn't know the name that I wanted to change but since my cursor was already over the headline, it used that as the default so I could just hit enter to select it.

As you can see the headline-face in this case is `rst-level-1`.

After I hit `enter` it took me to a dialog page to let me change the settings for this face.

In this case I just wanted to change the background color so I clicked on the bottom `Choose` button. You can enter values directly if you have something in mind, but I didn't so this seemed like the easier way to do it, since it brings up a color picker so you can see what the colors look like.

I decided to go with *deep sky blue* so I moved my cursor over that row in the color picker and hit ``enter``. This closes the color-picker close and updates the color in the customization dialog.

This changes the dialog but doesn't actually change the settings. To do that you have to move you cursor to ``Apply and Save`` and hit ``enter``. This updates the `sample` color so you can see what it now looks like.

When I then switched back to my original editing buffer, the headline now had a blue background.

Which doesn't look as nice as I thought it would so I changed again. Same steps, different colors.

Describe Face
-------------

Another useful command is ``M-x describe-face`` which shows you the settings for a face. This is what it showed after I made another change to my headline color.

If you click on `customize this face` up at the top-right of the window it takes you to the same dialog that the ``M-x customize-face`` command takes you to.
