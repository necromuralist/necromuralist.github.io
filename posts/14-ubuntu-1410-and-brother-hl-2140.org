I have a [[http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail/1/hl2140/Overview][Brother HL-2140 Laser Printer]] which was working previously but for some reason gave me a CUPs error when I tried to print today (I think this was the first time I'd tried to print since upgrading to Ubuntu 14.10). I searched for the error on the web and found this [[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1748457][forum post]] that didn't address my problem directly but did address a problem I had when I set up my printer before (on Ubuntu 14.04 - I'm using 14.10 now) where the printer would churn out blank pages instead of printing what I wanted so I decided to give it a try again. There are a few suggestions on the page but the two I tried both suggested using a different driver.

The first suggestion I tried was to use the /HL-2170/ instead of the/HL-2140./ This worked when I printed the first test page but after that it just silently failed no matter what I tried to install.

The next suggestion I tried was to use the /Brother HL-2140 Foomatic/hpijs-pcl5e/ driver. This didn't print any pages for me and gave a =Idle - filter failed= error in the printer properties dialogue
box. I don't know what the message means, but since I fixed it without knowing, I guess I don't need to know.

Sandwiched between the /HL-2170/ and the /HL-2140/ models in the list of available drivers was the /HL-2142/ model. Since it seemed close enough to the 2140 (only off by two) I decided to try it and for whatever reason it worked. I'm pretty sure I used one of drivers the forum post suggested when I was using 14.04 (and the default /HL-2140/ driver before that) but something seems to have changed again.

There's two lessons here:

  1. Use the /HL-2142/ driver for the /Brother HL-2140/ printer on Ubuntu 14.10
  2. Try drivers for similar models if you upgrade your Ubuntu installation and the printer stops working
