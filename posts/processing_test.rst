A P5 (Processing) Test
======================

This is a `p5 <http://p5js.org/>`_ test based on their `get started <http://p5js.org/get-started/>`_ tutorial. It's also an indirect test of using the `raw` directive to write HTML to pass to `nikola`.

First the link to the library.

.. raw:: html

   <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.4.21/p5.js"></script>


And now the sketch.
         
.. raw:: html

   <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src='get_started.js'></script>
