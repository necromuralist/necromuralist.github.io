* Background
  [[http://www.litech.org/radvd/][radvd]] (the router advertisement daemon) sends IPv6 advertisements and responds to node IPv6 requests. Here's the description from the man page.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*radvd* is the router advertisement daemon for IPv6. It listens to router solicitations and sends router advertisements as described in "Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)" (RFC 4861). With these advertisements hosts can automatically configure their addresses and some other parameters. They also can choose a default router based on these advertisements. 
#+END_QUOTE

* Installation and Setup
  Setting *radvd* is suspiciously easy compared to other linux services. First you install it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo apt install radvd
#+END_EXAMPLE

Installing it will also start the service so we can use =systemctl= to check how it's doing.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
systemctl status radvd
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
systemctl status radvd
● radvd.service - LSB: Router Advertising Daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/radvd; bad; vendor preset: enabled)

Jul 20 12:39:18 asgaard systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Router Advertising Daemon...
Jul 20 12:39:19 asgaard radvd[8532]: Starting radvd:

#+END_EXAMPLE

You can see in the output that there's a line with =/etc/radvd.conf does not exist or is empty.=. To fix this we're going to create the configuration file.

** The Configuration File
Now create a configuration file (named =radvd.conf=). Here's an example.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
interface eth0
{
MinRtrAdvInterval 3;
MaxRtrAdvInterval 4;
AdvSendAdvert on;
AdvManagedFlag on;
prefix 2001:db7::/64
{ AdvValidLifetime 14300; AdvPreferredLifetime 14200; }
;
};
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that the interface name depends on your system. Most linux systems don't use the =eth0= convention anymore. On my desktop the ethernet inteface is called =enp1s0= and on my raspberry pi it's =enxb827eb6c9129= so make sure you check what your interface name is using =ifconfig=.

Now move (or copy) the config file into =/etc/=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo mv radvd.conf /etc/
#+END_EXAMPLE

And then restart =radvd= and check its state.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo service radvd restart
systemctl status radvd
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
● radvd.service - LSB: Router Advertising Daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/radvd; bad; vendor preset: enabled)

  Process: 10017 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/radvd start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

Jul 20 12:41:36 asgaard systemd[1]: Starting LSB: Router Advertising Daemon...

Jul 20 12:41:36 asgaard systemd[1]: Started LSB: Router Advertising Daemon.
#+END_EXAMPLE

So the warning about the configuration file went away, now we have to fix the =IPv6 forwarding seems to be disabled.= error.

** Enable IPv6 Forwarding
   For now you can enable it at the command line.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
#+END_EXAMPLE

And restart and check =radvd= again.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo service radvd restart
systemctl status radvd
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
● radvd.service - LSB: Router Advertising Daemon

#+END_EXAMPLE

So it looks like our daemon is working. If you restart the server, though, the IPv6 port forwarding won't be enabled so open up =/etc/sysctl.conf= and un-comment out the following line.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now the next time you power on the computer it should be enabled.

* Checking
  To check if it's working you can put another device on the LAN and check =ifconfig=. In our =radvd.conf= file we defined the prefix for the address:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
prefix 2001:db7::/64
#+END_EXAMPLE

So in the =ifconfig= output  we should see an entry for an IPv6 address that starts with =2001:db7::=. In fact I ended up with two.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        inet6 2001:db7::b8b4:6adf:6267:5571  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 2001:db7::a80c:1a05:eaac:c1e8  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
#+END_EXAMPLE
